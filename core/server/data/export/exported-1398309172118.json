Studio.  Here are the two most current links to download what you need.\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Download Visual C# 2008 Express\n</strong><a

Game Studio 3.0 project type, then you have a successful installation!  As you can see, we have several options for games we can build.  The best part about XNA is that we can build a Windows game, and then use the same code to build 360 or Zune games.  For my purposes, I'll start out by developing a Windows game.  The major reason behind this is that you need to purchase a Creators Club subscription ($99) in order to test, debug, and deploy games to the Xbox 360.  PC games are free to develop, and have no deployment issues.\n\nHave fun with your own projects!\n\n<img

of an XNA Application","slug":"anatomy-of-an-xna-application","markdown":"So you have your environment set up, and you create your first XNA project.  XNA Game Studio sets up your project, and gives you a great skeleton for developing your game.  Below is the complete \"Game1.cs\" file you're given.  I recommend renaming this file and class to something a bit more meaningful.\n<pre

GraphicsDeviceManager(this);\n            Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";\n        }\n\n        ///\n        /// Allows the game to perform any initialization it needs to before starting to

We'll ignore the using statements, and get right into the meat of the class.  Below is a snippet of the code.  We're given two objects, GraphicsDeviceManager and SpriteBatch.  The GraphicsDeviceManager helps us determine the type of device we're going to be outputting to.  This can range from various PC graphics cards to the Zune or Xbox 360.  We'll use this class later to alter our output based on users environment.  Next is the SpriteBatch.  Think of this as a List<> of images you want to draw to the screen.  This will be covered a little bit later in the Draw() method.\n\nNext is the game class constructor, which sets up the GraphicsDeviceManager and sets our Content pipeline.  The content pipeline is a post all in itself, so don't worry too much about it now.  The Initialize() method provides you a place to do anything you need to do before the game runs.  I'm at a loss for a good example of what you would put here, but if I ever think of one, I'll be sure to let you know.\n\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">\nGraphicsDeviceManager graphics;\n        SpriteBatch spriteBatch;\n\n        public Game1()\n        {\n            graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);\n            Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";\n        }\n\n        ///\n        /// Allows the game to perform any initialization it needs to before starting to run.\n        /// This is where it can query for any required services and load any non-graphic\n        /// related content.  Calling base.Initialize will enumerate through any components\n        /// and initialize them as well.\n        ///\n        protected override void Initialize()\n        {\n            // TODO: Add your initialization logic here\n\n            base.Initialize();\n        }\n</pre>\n\nNext are our Load and Unload content methods.  The purpose of these methods are to load all the content you need to start the game.  The comment says \"load all your content\", but realistically you don't want to do that.  For demos, this is ok.  For commercial games, you want to load as little as possible to get the user going and load as necessary.  That's what loading screens are for!\n\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">\n        ///\n        /// LoadContent will be called once per game and is the place to load\n        /// all of your content.\n        ///\n        protected override void LoadContent()\n        {\n            // Create a new SpriteBatch, which can be used to draw textures.\n            spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);\n\n            // TODO: use this.Content to load your game content here\n        }\n\n        ///\n        /// UnloadContent will be called once per game and is the place to unload\n        /// all content.\n        ///\n        protected override void UnloadContent()\n        {\n            // TODO: Unload any non ContentManager content here\n        }\n</pre>\n\nThe last two methods are the meat of your XNA application.  The Update() method is provided to you as a way to update the state of your game.  As the comment says, you use this method to update your world, check for collisions, gather input, play audio, etc.  By default, you're given code that will detect a button press from an Xbox 360 controller.  Keep in mind when designing your games if you are going to accept input from just a 360 controller, keyboard, mouse, or all of the above.\n\nFinally, there is the Draw method, and this is where all your content makes it onto the screen.  The first line clears the screen.  This is a very necessary step.  Failing to clear the screen would lead to some wacky results.  Think of the screen as a canvas.  You can't simply redraw on top of what you've already drawn.  Calling the clear method results in a new canvas.  This screen is where our friend SpriteBatch will come in handy.\n\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">\n        ///\n        /// Allows the game to run logic such as updating the world,\n        /// checking for collisions, gathering input, and playing audio.\n        ///\n        /// Provides a snapshot of timing values.\n        protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            // Allows the game to exit\n            if (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Back == ButtonState.Pressed)\n                this.Exit();\n\n            // TODO: Add your update logic here\n\n            base.Update(gameTime);\n        }\n\n        ///\n        /// This is called when the game should draw itself.\n        ///\n        /// Provides a snapshot of timing values.\n        protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);\n\n            // TODO: Add your drawing code here\n\n            base.Draw(gameTime);\n        }\n</pre>\n\nAnd that's about it!  Press Ctrl-F5 to build and run your first XNA application.  You should be greeted with a pretty, Cornflower Blue screen.  What you're not seeing is your Update and Draw methods being called continuously.\n\nWhat's next for our little application?  For starters, we need to get some stuff on the screen.  For my game, I'm going to be using a tile based game, so my next entry will revolve around loading tile sets and drawing them to the screen.\n\nHappy developing!","html":"<p>So you have your environment set up, and you create your first XNA project.  XNA Game Studio sets up your project, and gives you a great skeleton for developing your game.  Below is the complete \"Game1.cs\" file you're given.  I recommend renaming this file and class to something a bit more meaningful.  </p>\n\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">using System;  \nusing System.Collections.Generic;  \nusing System.Linq;  \nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework;  \nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio;  \nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content;  \nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GamerServices;  \nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;  \nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input;  \nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media;  \nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Net;  \nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Storage;\n\nnamespace LastAgent  \n{\n    ///\n    /// This is the main type for your game\n    ///\n    public class Game1 : Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game\n    {\n        GraphicsDeviceManager graphics;\n        SpriteBatch spriteBatch;\n\n        public Game1()\n        {\n            graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);\n            Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";\n        }\n\n        ///\n        /// Allows the game to perform any initialization it needs to before starting to run.\n        /// This is where it can query for any required services and load any non-graphic\n        /// related content.

We'll ignore the using statements, and get right into the meat of the class.  Below is a snippet of the code.  We're given two objects, GraphicsDeviceManager and SpriteBatch.  The GraphicsDeviceManager helps us determine the type of device we're going to be outputting to.  This can range from various PC graphics cards to the Zune or Xbox 360.  We'll use this class later to alter our output based on users environment.  Next is the SpriteBatch.  Think of this as a List<> of images you want to draw to the screen.  This will be covered a little bit later in the Draw() method.\n\nNext is the game class constructor, which sets up the GraphicsDeviceManager and sets our Content pipeline.  The content pipeline is a post all in itself, so don't worry too much about it now.  The Initialize() method provides you a place to do anything you need to do before the game runs.  I'm at a loss for a good example of what you would put here, but if I ever think of one, I'll be sure to let you know.\n\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">  \nGraphicsDeviceManager graphics;  \n        SpriteBatch spriteBatch;\n\n        public Game1()\n        {\n            graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);\n            Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";\n        }\n\n        ///\n        /// Allows the game to perform any initialization it needs to before starting to run.\n        /// This is where it can query for any required services and load any non-graphic\n        /// related content.  Calling base.Initialize will enumerate through any components\n        /// and initialize them as well.\n        ///\n        protected override void Initialize()\n        {\n            // TODO: Add your initialization logic here\n\n            base.Initialize();\n        }\n</pre>\n\n<p>Next are our Load and Unload content methods.  The purpose of these methods are to load all the content you need to start the game.  The comment says \"load all your content\", but realistically you don't want to do that.  For demos, this is ok.  For commercial games, you want to load as little as possible to get the user going and load as necessary.  That's what loading screens are for!</p>\n\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">  \n        ///\n        /// LoadContent will be called once per game and is the place to load\n        /// all of your content.\n        ///\n        protected override void LoadContent()\n        {\n            // Create a new SpriteBatch, which can be used to draw textures.\n            spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);\n\n            // TODO: use this.Content to load your game content here\n        }\n\n        ///\n        /// UnloadContent will be called once per game and is the place to unload\n        /// all content.\n        ///\n        protected override void UnloadContent()\n        {\n            // TODO: Unload any non ContentManager content here\n        }\n</pre>\n\n<p>The last two methods are the meat of your XNA application.  The Update() method is provided to you as a way to update the state of your game.  As the comment says, you use this method to update your world, check for collisions, gather input, play audio, etc.  By default, you're given code that will detect a button press from an Xbox 360 controller.  Keep in mind when designing your games if you are going to accept input from just a 360 controller, keyboard, mouse, or all of the above.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there is the Draw method, and this is where all your content makes it onto the screen.  The first line clears the screen.  This is a very necessary step.  Failing to clear the screen would lead to some wacky results.  Think of the screen as a canvas.  You can't simply redraw on top of what you've already drawn.  Calling the clear method results in a new canvas.  This screen is where our friend SpriteBatch will come in handy.</p>\n\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">  \n        ///\n        /// Allows the game to run logic such as updating the world,\n        /// checking for collisions, gathering input, and playing audio.\n        ///\n        /// Provides a snapshot of timing values.\n        protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            // Allows the game to exit\n            if (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Back == ButtonState.Pressed)\n                this.Exit();\n\n            // TODO: Add your update logic here\n\n            base.Update(gameTime);\n        }\n\n        ///\n        /// This is called when the game should draw itself.\n        ///\n        /// Provides a snapshot of timing values.\n        protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);\n\n            // TODO: Add your drawing code here\n\n            base.Draw(gameTime);\n        }\n</pre>\n\n<p>And that's about it!  Press Ctrl-F5 to build and run your first XNA application.  You should be greeted with a pretty, Cornflower Blue screen.  What you're not seeing is your Update and Draw methods being called continuously.</p>\n\n<p>What's next for our little application?  For starters, we need to get some stuff on the screen.

In the world of rich media, however, WinForms falls flat.  They do not have the aesthetic appeal we're looking for in graphically appealing applications.  Windows Presentation Foundation has allowed us to go to a whole new level by providing tools for developing powerful, easy to customize applications.

In the world of rich media, however, WinForms falls flat.  They do not have the aesthetic appeal we're looking for in graphically appealing applications.  Windows Presentation Foundation has allowed us to go to a whole new level by providing tools for developing powerful, easy to customize applications.

plan, and it immediately occurred to me that this is the perfect diet plan for developers.  Here is the gist of the plan:  You're allotted x number of points a day.  Points come from the foods and drinks you put into your body.  The number of points you're allowed is based on your gender, weight, height, and activity level.\n\nThe points in a piece of food is determined by the number of calories, total fat, and fiber content of the food.  Anyone that pays to join Weight Watchers is given a calculator for determining the points.  In reality, it's just an equation.  Developers like equations.  We can understand equations.  Here is the equation for Weight Watchers Points:\n\nPOINTS = (Calories / 50) + (Total Fat / 12) - (MIN(Fiber, 4) / 5)\n\nOoooh.  That could easily be plugged into a script.  How does this fit into the real world?  My number of points allotted per day is 39.  There is a formula for figuring that out, but I've been unable to find it.  If/when I do, I'll post it here.  But for the record, I'm 6'1, 259 pounds and sit at a desk all day.  If you weigh more than I do, add 1 point per 10 pound increment (260 pounds is technically 40 points).  If you weight less, subtract 1 point per 10 pound increment.  If you are taller than me, add a point or two.  If you're shorter, subtract a point or two.  You should see what I mean.\n\nSay I go to Burger King, and buy a Whopper with cheese.  That weighs in at 19 pounds (the mayo kills it).  After eating a Whopper, I've already had half my number of points for the day.  Weight Watchers says that's cool, but be careful with your other 20 points.  You still eat what you want, just eat less of it and try to find better alternatives.\n\nSo now you can do the Weight Watchers plan for free.  Use the points equation to do whatever you want.  Lose weight mathematically!","html":"<p>Consider this: programmers are typically overweight.  It's our nature.  Ninety-five percent of our job is sitting behind a

of a Computer Scientist","slug":"definition-of-a-computer-scientist","markdown":"What is a computer scientist?  Google gives the definition: a scientist who specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computers.  In most of our minds, a computer scientist is a person that builds computer systems.  More recognizable names (at least in terms of what a person with a computer science degree would be hired for) for a computer scientist would be developer, coder, software engineer, or software architect.  A lot of people will argue with me that computer scientist is more than just a coder, and I would fully agree.  Although, when a person wants to be a software developer, they are forced most of the time into a computer science program, as it's the best way for they to obtain the skills required to build large software systems.\n\nBut the definition is besides the point.  The real point of this post is to comment on a conversation retold to me by a colleague who's taking a senior-level college course.  To put the conversation into perspective, I need to describe the course (and for the record, I have taken this course myself several years ago).  This course is a project management course for wannabe computer scientists.  In the first semester of the class, students are required to come up with \"problems\" and probable solutions to them.  The problem and solution are then pitched to a panel of industry professionals.  The solution is actually implemented within the second semester.  As you might think, developing a problem from within thin air is quite daunting.  Eventually though, students discover a problem that obtains approval from the professor.\n\nThis conversation spawned due to my colleague's group not being able to find a problem.  As far as I was told, several problems were proposed and spot down.  When a particular idea was shot down, the professor said, \"<strong>Your job as computer scientists is to  innovate.</strong>\"\n\nThis statement is just *wrong*.  Your job as a computer scientist is not to innovate!  Your job as a computer scientist is to SOLVE PROBLEMS.  Now, it is possible for a problem to be solved in an innovative manner, but you should never innovate for the sake of innovation.  In the real world (definition: the world outside of academia), you will be given problems to solve, and you will be expected to solve them.  Furthermore, you will be given your problems, not expected to discover them on your own.  Creating your own problems to solve would make you an entrepreneur, not a computer scientist (which you would be when you actually solved the problem).\n\nFor example, let's say I have a glass window and at 5:00 everyday the sun shines through, displaying a terrible glare on my computer screen.  An innovative solution to the problem would be to design a microfilm composite that reduced the glare depending on the amount of sunlight shining through.  Another solution would be to buy a set of blinds.  Not \"innovative\" by any means, but it solved the problem.\n\nWhat advice do I have for the group of computer science student trying to get through this project?  Don't try to come up with a brand new problem.  That's impractical, or the solution to the problem is to high of a level for you to understand as an undergraduate.  Instead, try to take an existing problem with bad solution.  I guess you could say you should take a bad solution and *innovate*?  Ideally, you just want to get through the semester.  When you enter the \"real world\", the problems will come to you.  At least these problems will be paid, and you won't have to worry while worrying about an English midterm, linear algebra homework, and your seventeenth algorithms assignment.\n\nFinally, take everything your professor says with a grain of salt.  They probably haven't seen the real world in a long time.","html":"<p>What is a computer scientist?  Google gives the definition: a scientist who specializes in

interest in technologies they might not have heard about.\n\nI also attended Joel Cochran's talk on Expression Blend.  I honestly didn't know Blend could do half the things he showed us.  Why have I been spending all this time learning XAML?!  Afterwards, Kevin Hazzard gave me a personal lesson on Pex and Code Contracts, two technologies I have never looked at before.  If you're doing any sort of unit testing, look into Pex.  I was amazed at the number of test cases Pex created for a single method, and if I were writing the tests, I would have probably guessed only 3-4 of the 12 it created.\n\nI met a lot of new friends, and had great discussions with current ones.  This community is nothing without the people.  Big thanks to Robin Edwards for hosting us.  I can't wait until next time!\n\nRichmond Code Camp is April 25th, 2009!","html":"<p>Code camp season has officially begun for me.  This past weekend, I attended and presented at the Roanoke Code Camp.  I gave my first

to Certification","slug":"road-to-certification","markdown":"When I was in college, I worked for an IT shop.  I went around and fixed machines, and did the basic tech support type of stuff you expect to do when you're in school.  However, I knew that I definitely didn't want to do tech support for the rest of my life.  I started learning about the system administration side of the house, and what I could do to progress my career in that direction.  Essentially, that lead me to certifcations.  In this case, it was the certification route for Windows Server 2003.\n\nA MCSE, or Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer, in Windows Server 2003 is a HARD certification to get.  Essentially it's a group of 7 tests.  You have to earn another certification along the way (MCSA, Systems Administrator).  I studied hard, and lived in 2003 virtual machines.  My goal was to learn the material as well as I could, and prove myself as a professional.  Eventually, I passed my 7th test and earn my certification.  This was a personal achievement of mine, because there were *several* collegues of mine who could barely pass the 2nd test.\n\nI look at certification as a double edge sword.  A good majority of people with certifications are paper professionals.  They've been able to read and study the material, and retain it long enough to pass a test.  These people would look good on a resume.  \"Oh you have a MCSE, you must be a great person to hire.\"  Later, we discover these people have no clue what they're doing as they have never used any of their information except for answering questions on a test.\n\nI graduated from college with my Computer Science degree and moved into the development field.  The knowledge obtained from earning my MCSE has helped me in many situations, even if its simply describe to my system administrator what my needs on the network are.  Since all my work has been .NET centric, and I've been heavily involved in the .NET communities, I decided that I wanted to go from my application developer certifications.  While the track isn't nearly as extensive as my MCSE was, I'm looking forward to learning something new with each test.\n\nFor those interested in the test I'm studying for, it's the 70-536: Application Development Foundations (or .NET 101).  Luckily, I'm starting this journey at the same time as my good friend <a href=\"http://www.developingfor.net/\">Joel Cochran</a>.  I found it was very important to have a \"study buddy\", or someone to keep you on track and to bounce questions off of.  You're 200% more likely to pass with a study buddy than not having one.\n\nWhat certs do you have?  Any recommendations to other people going for their certications?  Let me know if you love them or hate

Creators Club trial memberships.  What does the trial membership provide?  It provides the user to run and debug their games on the XBOX 360.\n\nLast night I signed up for DreamBuildPlay, and received my free trial.  The first step in the process is to download the XNA Game Studio connector.  Once this is done, you can \"sync\" your XBOX with your instance of Visual Studio.  I build a quick app to display some text of the screen, and provided myself the ability to move the text around on the screen using the controller.  Then press go ole F5.\n\nThere is no way to describe the experience other than this.  The XNA team had a vision of what awesome was.  However, they didn't know how to turn awesome into a product.  After months and months of thinking, debating, and building, they release XNA.  The A in XNA stands for awesome.  The X and N are just there to throw you off.  Running your own game on an XBOX is an amazing experience.\n\nThere are some issues.  First, TVs don't all display the same way.  Whereas on our monitors, the upper left hand corner is always coordinate (0, 0).  On TV's the (0, 0) mark is off screen.  This is due to over scan, and it's something I thought the XBOX would be able to accommodate for.  Not a big deal, but it does throw off a few algorithms.  I have a wide screen plasma TV, and the way my game renders on it is different than the way it would render

just had our 7th meeting a few weeks ago, and I’m seeing a trend of attendee’s starting to occur.&#160; Our first meeting was an anomaly.&#160; We had roughly 40 attendees.&#160; I had prepared myself for this, and accepted that it would not be the norm.&#160; Our meetings from then on varied between 15-25 people per month.&#160; However, I am discovering that this number is growing month to month.&#160; Not by leaps and bounds, but by one person at a time.&#160; One month I would have 19 attendees, then 20, then 22, and then 25.&#160; People are progressively coming back to the

and our next meeting.&#160; While this is “good enough”, I believe that it presents a poor image of the group.&#160; That’s 100% my fault, because I haven’t put the time or resources towards improving the site.&#160; What’s the solution?&#160; I’m in the process of designing and rebuilding a new HRNUG website which will run on Silverlight 3.&#160; The backend will be completely data-driven so that we can retain past meeting information, future meeting information, and special event information easier.&#160; Currently, I would have to retain all the information by hand.&#160; That’s what databases are for!</p>  <p>Next, we have an important event coming up in September.&#160; The MSDN Mid-Atlantic Roadshow is coming to our area.&#160; This is a great opportunity to get the user group name out to people who’ve never heard of it.&#160; I’m working with a graphic designer friend of mine to prepare pamphlets and posters for HRNUG.&#160; I can then pass these out at the Roadshow, and hopefully expose more people to the group.&#160; I’d also like to launch the new website at this time.</p>  <p>Thirdly, I need to help HRNUG go to the next level by sponsoring a developer event of our own.&#160; I’ve been speaking with members of the group, and we’re discussing the probability of doing a Give Camp in our area.&#160; A Give Camp is a 48-hour developer event (that’s consecutive), where developers, graphic designers, and other IT professors come together in order to provide our services to non-profit organizations (who would typically not have the budget for these

Let’s imagine though, for example, that you’re interviewing for a development position.&#160; The hiring process comes down to two folks.&#160; You and another person.&#160; You are slightly more qualified for the position than the other person.&#160; However, the other person is involved in the developer community.&#160; Which candidate is worth more to the company?&#160; Naturally, you would say you were.&#160; You’re more qualified!&#160; I would say the other person is.&#160; Worth is measured several different ways.&#160; However, I would rather hire a community involved person than someone who is not (or doesn’t want to be).&#160; Why?&#160; They are typically more up to date on new technologies, methodologies, and software development ideas.&#160; Their potential network is much larger than yours.&#160; By them being involved, they are promoting my company by working for me.&#160; My company gets more exposure by having a community involved person than not having one.&#160; That’s worth a lot.</p>  <p>I tend to put a lot of value on the networking aspect of the community.&#160; Let’s say for example, I have an issue with an ASP.NET site I’m working on.&#160; Something’s not working, and I’ve exhausted all avenues I had to find the answer.&#160;

Makes A Good Bug Report?","slug":"what-makes-a-good-bug-report","markdown":"As developers, we understand one fundamental truth: our software is going to break.  It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.  Hopefully on your team, you have a dedicated testing staff.  Other teams are not quite as lucky.  Their testers might be the project manager, or a single person who's responsible for testing all software produced by your company.\n\nDevelopers are terrible at testing their own software.  I'm my own worst tester, and that's because I have a large understanding of how it works.  Without trying, I can make the software work flawlessly each and every time.  On my teams, I state that I want others using my code as much as possible.  But what happens if something breaks?\n\nHopefully your company employs a bug track of some sort.  For example, my company uses FogBugz for all of our bug tracking.  However, not many people in my company understand how to write a useful bug report.  My goal is to outline some of the minor things that can be done to make a bug report more helpful to the developer who's going to be using it.\n<h1>1. Use descriptive titles</h1>\nWhenever I see a bug with a title like \"Got an error in (name a section of the app)\", I die a little inside.  I also see bug titles every day where it's just the name of the section of the app, for example \"Order Screen\" or \"Customer Profile\".  Imagine you're a developer who's going through a bug list.  I tend to put these bugs off until later because in order to figure out what I need to do, I have to open the bug.\n\nInstead, let's try for bug titles like this: \"Error 'unable to save user information' when on the user profile screen\".  I know what the error is, and where it is.  That's helpful!  Or \"Order Confirmation: Clicking OK doesn't respond\".  Again, very helpful.  As the developer, I don't have to guess what the problem is.\n<h1>2. Steps to reproduce</h1>\nFor the past few weeks, we've had this intermittent problem when saving a user's profile.  Every single time it's occurred, I'm nowhere near the tester.  I've been unable to reproduce it.  Every time it happens, I ask \"what was the input?\" and I'm constantly answered with \"I don't know\".  Without a details list of steps for reproducing the bug, I cannot guarantee that I'll be able to fix the bug.  When using guideline #3, you can save a lot of time.\n<h1>3. Screen shots, screen shots, screen shots</h1>\nA picture is worth a 1,000 words.  If you're having trouble verbalizing what the problem is, take a screen shot.  Please make sure that a screen shot is worthwhile though.  If you're working on a web application, and it renders correctly in Firefox, but not in IE, take a screen shot!  If you've filled out a 15 field form, and it errors out, take a screen shot!  When used in combination with guideline #2, you don't have to write out all the information typed into the form.\n<h1>4. Prioritize correctly</h1>\nWhen you're adding a bug to the system, take into consideration how important fixing the bug is to the current or next release.  If there is a misspelled word, I wouldn't classify it as a \"MUST FIX!\".  Instead, you should be giving it a lower priority, such as a \"Medium\" or \"When there is time\".  If the system is unable to process customer orders, which is the sole reason for using the system, then you might want to mark that as a \"MUST FIX!\".\n\nThis guideline is subjective though.  The person in charge of the next release, a project manager or lead developer, should have final say over what priority a bug is.\n<h1>5. Expectations</h1>\nIf the system did something you didn't quite expect to happen, let the developer know.  In many cases, whatever happened was the product working as designed.  This is a perfect opportunity to discuss flow of application.  One person's design might not make sense to someone else.\n\nFor example, if the app allows you to hand type in dates, but only in the DD/MM/YYYY format and you typed in MM/DD/YYYY format, the system will fail.  That's not exactly a bug, because the system is set up to only accept dates in a certain format, but it is a bug in terms that the system didn't do what you expected.\n<h1>6. One Issue Per Bug Report</h1>\nI can understand how tedious it must be to create a bug report.  Seriously, what is it?  Two, maybe three clicks?  When creating a bug report, make sure you're only referencing one issue.  That way individual issues can be prioritized and worked on solely by themselves.  Verification can be done on a single issue, and not a group.  When you list multiple items in a bug, you're risking that one item might be missed.  Additionally, if I'm the developer on the bug, I can't close it out until all items in the bug have been satisfied.  I might be able to fix all but one item, and the bug will remain in the tracker until I have time or resources to fix it.  If the bugs were individual, I could close out all the fixed issues and they could be evaluated again.\n\n<hr />When writing your next bug report, please take these guidelines into account and make it easier on your developers.\n\nI welcome any question or comments!  What do you think?  Anything you would add to the list?  Remove?  Let me know in the comments!","html":"<p>As developers, we understand one fundamental truth: our software is going to break.  It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.  Hopefully on your team, you have a dedicated testing staff.  Other teams are not quite as lucky.  Their testers might be the project manager, or a single person who's responsible for testing all software produced by your company.</p>\n\n<p>Developers are terrible at testing their own software.  I'm my own worst tester, and that's because I have a large understanding of how it works.  Without trying, I can make the software work flawlessly each and every time.  On my teams, I state that I want others using my code as much as possible.  But what happens if something breaks?</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully your company employs a bug track of some sort.  For example, my company uses FogBugz for all of our bug tracking.  However, not many people in my company understand how to write a useful bug report.  My goal is to outline some of the minor things that can be done to make a bug report more helpful to the developer who's going to be using it.  </p>\n\n<h1>1. Use descriptive titles</h1>  \n\n<p>Whenever I see a bug with a title like \"Got an error in (name a section of the app)\", I die a little inside.  I also see bug titles every day where it's just the name of the section of the app, for example \"Order Screen\" or \"Customer Profile\".  Imagine you're a developer who's going through a bug list.  I tend to put these bugs off until later because in order to figure out what I need to do, I have to open the bug.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, let's try for bug titles like this: \"Error 'unable to save user information' when on the user profile screen\".  I know what the error is, and where it is.  That's helpful!  Or \"Order Confirmation: Clicking OK doesn't respond\".  Again, very helpful.  As the developer, I don't have to guess what the problem is.  </p>\n\n<h1>2. Steps to reproduce</h1>  \n\n<p>For the past few weeks, we've had this intermittent problem when saving a user's profile.  Every single time it's occurred, I'm nowhere near the tester.  I've been unable to reproduce it.  Every time it happens, I ask \"what was the input?\" and I'm constantly answered with \"I don't know\".  Without a details list of steps for reproducing the bug, I cannot guarantee that I'll be able to fix the bug.  When using guideline #3, you can save a lot of time.  </p>\n\n<h1>3. Screen shots, screen shots, screen shots</h1>  \n\n<p>A picture is worth a 1,000 words.  If you're having trouble verbalizing what the problem is, take a screen shot.  Please make sure that a screen shot is worthwhile though.  If you're working on a web application, and it renders correctly in Firefox, but not in IE, take a screen shot!  If you've filled out a 15 field form, and it errors out, take a screen shot!  When used in combination with guideline #2, you don't have to write out all the information typed into the form.  </p>\n\n<h1>4. Prioritize correctly</h1>  \n\n<p>When you're adding a bug to the system, take into consideration how important fixing the bug is to the current or next release.  If there is a misspelled word, I wouldn't classify it as a \"MUST FIX!\".  Instead, you should be giving it a lower priority, such as a \"Medium\" or \"When there is time\".  If the system is unable to process customer orders, which is the sole reason for using the system, then you might want to mark that as a \"MUST FIX!\".</p>\n\n<p>This guideline is subjective though.  The person in charge of the next release, a project manager or lead developer, should have final say over what priority a bug is.  </p>\n\n<h1>5. Expectations</h1>  \n\n<p>If the system did something you didn't quite expect to happen, let the developer know.  In many cases, whatever happened was the product working as designed.  This is a perfect opportunity to discuss flow of application.  One person's design might not make sense to someone else.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if the app allows you to hand type in dates, but only in the DD/MM/YYYY format and you typed in MM/DD/YYYY format, the system will fail.  That's not exactly a bug, because the system is set up to only accept dates in a certain format, but it is a bug in terms that the system didn't do what you expected.  </p>\n\n<h1>6.

again.</p>\n\n<p><hr />When writing your next bug report, please take these guidelines into account and make it easier on your developers.</p>\n\n<p>I welcome any question or comments!  What do you

Code Camp Recap","slug":"raleigh-code-camp-recap","markdown":"This past weekend, I had the opportunity to attend Raleigh Code Camp, in Raleigh, NC.  This was my second time attending Raleigh, and I have to say that I’m still impressed with the quality of speakers and attendee’s.  One of my favorite quotes during Saturday was that the difference between a speaker and an attendee is two weeks.  This event didn’t have an open spaces section, so I was able to sit in on several presentations.\n\n<strong>Speakers Dinner</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Depending on who you talk to, speakers dinners are great or not.  Some people think it’s a great way for speakers, volunteers, and coordinators to get together and say “thanks” for taking time out of their busy schedules to come down and make the event possible.  Others will say that speaker dinners are “elitist”, and that the attendee’s should be invited to come participate.  I’m not really on one side or the other.  I enjoy speaker dinners.  Generally, speakers are really good friends of mine, and this is a great chance for us to catch up.  Dinner was hosted at “Ben’s Place” in Raleigh.  Food was delicious, but the portions were a bit small.  I was able to meet several speakers I haven’t been able to meet before.  Afterwards, several of us went to see “Extract” at the local movie theatre.  Short review, good movie, but not as good as <em>Office Space</em>.</span>\n\n<strong>jQuery From The Ground Up</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Technically,<em> jQuery From The Ground Up</em> is my second presentation ever.  I was a little nervous with this presentation.  With my last talk, I grew comfortable with my demo material.  While jQuery isn’t new material to me, my demo was.  I got a lot of positive feedback from the talk.  One person even thanked me for making a mistake in my code.  It’s amazing to me now, but there is this mindset that speakers have to be “perfect’, and our demos have to be perfect.  I’m sorry, but I don’t think a presentation is “good” unless it has at least one hiccup. </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">I love giving presentations for the first time, because at the end, I always have a checklist of things I’d like to add, change, and remove from my talk.  Now I have a great idea of what works and what doesn’t.  I’m giving this talk again at Richmond Code Camp on October 3rd. </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><strong>Bootstrapping</strong></span>\n\nI went to <a href=\"http://kohari.org/\">Nate Kohari’s</a> talk on bootstrapping your own business.  It’s always been something I’ve been interested in, and I really don’t have a good reason for not having done it.  My primary reason is that I have my wife and myself to support.  It’s difficult to say, “honey, I’m quitting my job so I can build my own product that might or might not work.”  I don’t think that would go over too well.\n\nNate did a great job discussing the pros and cons, and what to keep in mind if you decided to take on a startup head on.  I have several ideas bottled up in my head, and I think over the next few months that I might spend time developing one of those ideas into a product.  Time will tell!\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><strong>Database Design for Developers</strong></span>\n\n<a href=\"http://sqlblog.com/blogs/andy_leonard/default.aspx\">Andy Leonard</a> has always been one of my favorite people to listen to speak.  This presentation discussed tips and tricks for developers working with databases.  I learned quiet a bit.  One of my favorite moments was when Andy discussed using integer keys over other types.  Reason to use integers is because SQL Server optimizes for integers.  In my current project, I ended up added unique integer keys to some of my tables even though I had another non-integer column that could’ve been an unique key.  I didn’t realize it was a performance decision.  Oops!\n\n<strong>MVC Repository Pattern</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><a href=\"http://www.geeksandgurus.com/blogs/sjb/\">Steve Bodnar</a> is a good friend of mine in the Hampton Roads area.  This was his first non-FoxPro talk.  He spent the time talking about ASP.NET MVC Repository pattern.  Wow!  What a confusing topic.  Domain driven design in general is very difficult to comprehend (at least for me).  Steve did a great job of walking through his issues in trying to learn more about the pattern, and hopefully anyone looking at the pattern for the first time will be able to make strides without too much headache.  Steve’s also doing two more brand new MVC talks at Richmond Code Camp.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color:

Hazzard</a>, He discussed using the Skip() and Take() extension methods to form fit LINQ into building a SQL statement that’ll do all the heavy lifting for you.</p>  <p>Copying from Kevin’s example, I built the following code snippet:</p>  <pre lang=\"csharp\">int pageNumber = 1;\nint pageSize = 20;\n\nusing (var entity = new Entities())\n{\n\tvar recordSet = (from r in entity.SomeTable\n\t\t\torderby r.SomeID\n\t\t\tselect r);\n\trecordSet = recordSet.Skip((pageNumber - 1) * pageSize).Take(pageSize);\n\n\treturn recordSet;\n}</pre>\n\n<p>What’s nice about the

projects).&#160; </p>\n\n<p>I went the next step to see if I could build an extension method of my own that did all of the above for me automatically.&#160; Here was the result I came up

The first one is at the top of the screen, and the second one is in the bottom right hand corner of screenshot.&#160; Right now, we’re interested in the big “Download(jQuery);” button.&#160; Clicking that will yield one of two download types.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Production</strong></p>    <p><font color=\"#2e2e2e\">Downloading the production version of jQuery will result in a “minified” version of the file.&#160; This means you don’t have the luxury of nicely formatted code, comments, and overall readability.&#160; Only use this version if you’re going to production, and you’re not planning on touching the jQuery source.</font></p> </blockquote>  <br />  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Development</strong></p>    <p>The development version of jQuery is useful for most shops.&#160; If you’re interested in being able to read the jQuery source, everything in this file is fully commented and formatted for easy reading.&#160; The larger file size makes it not recommended for production environments.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Once you’ve downloaded the single .js file, you’re ready to go.&#160; In the next section, we’ll discuss actually bringing jQuery into your web pages.</p>  <h1>jQuery Documentation</h1>  <p>This is also a good time to stop and discuss the jQuery documentation.&#160; To put it simply, it’s awesome.&#160; The important thing to remember is that you’re not going remember everything about jQuery.&#160; Every time I sit down to work with jQuery, I have the documentation open and ready to use.&#160; </p>  <p>Everything you can do in jQuery can be narrowed down into 11 different categories:</p>  <ul>   <li>jQuery Core</li>    <li>Selectors</li>    <li>Attributes</li>    <li>Traversing</li>    <li>Manipulation</li>    <li>CSS</li>    <li>Events</li>    <li>Effects</li>    <li>Ajax</li>    <li>Utilities</li>    <li>jQuery UI</li> </ul>  <p>Let’s say, for example, I wanted to wire up a click event for an element on my page.&#160; If I looked under “Events”, I would find the click event waiting for me.&#160; If you go to the documentation for the click event, you’re given a useful and straight forward look at what it does and how to use it.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image1.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px;

Not only that, but underneath the code is a working version of the code in action.&#160; Use this to your advantage, and you’ll be up and running with jQuery in no time!</p>  <h1>Visual Studio 2008 Intellisense</h1>  <p>If you’re like me, you use Visual Studio.&#160; If you’re like me, you love Intellisense.&#160; While Visual Studio already has some support for JavaScript Intellisense, wouldn’t it be nice if Visual Studio gave you the same support for jQuery!</p>  <p>Wait no longer!&#160; Around the time ASP.NET MVC was coming down the pipe, Microsoft announced full support for jQuery Intellisense.&#160; If you’re starting an MVC application, you get the Intellisense right out of the box!</p>  <p>But what if you’re working with an older version of jQuery or web forms application!&#160;

Enjoy!</p>","html":"<p>As part of my effort to put more technical content onto my blog, I’ve decided to break my current talk “jQuery From The Ground Up” into a blog series. My goal here is to go into a little bit more in depth, and try to answer any questions that typically come up during my talk.</p>  <ol>   <li><a href=\"http://www.kevgriffin.com/blog/index.php/2009/10/21/jquery-from-the-ground-up-part-i-what-is-jquery/\">What Is jQuery?</a></li>    <li><strong>Getting jQuery</strong> </li>    <li>Setting Up jQuery </li>    <li>What’s a Selector? </li>    <li>Doing Something Useful </li>    <li>jQuery UI </li>    <li>Plugins, Plugins, Plugins </li> </ol>  <h1>Getting Your Hands On jQuery</h1>  <p>This is the easy stuff.&#160; You want to use jQuery, but you don’t have any idea where to get it.&#160; Point your web browser of choice to <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\">http://www.jquery.com</a>.&#160; You should be welcomed with a page like this:</p>  <p><a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image_thumb.png\" width=\"576\" height=\"261\" /></a> </p>  <p>You’ll notice there are two buttons on the screen that say “Download”.&#160; The first one is at the top of the screen, and the second one is in the bottom right hand corner of screenshot.&#160; Right now, we’re interested in the big “Download(jQuery);” button.&#160; Clicking that will yield one of two download types.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Production</strong></p>    <p><font color=\"#2e2e2e\">Downloading the production version of jQuery will result in a “minified” version of the file.&#160; This means you don’t have the luxury of nicely formatted code, comments, and overall readability.&#160; Only use this version if you’re going to production, and you’re not planning on touching the jQuery source.</font></p> </blockquote>  <br />  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Development</strong></p>    <p>The development version of jQuery is useful for most shops.&#160; If you’re interested in being able to read the jQuery source, everything in this file is fully commented and formatted for easy reading.&#160; The larger file size makes it not recommended for production environments.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Once you’ve downloaded the single .js file, you’re ready to go.&#160; In the next section, we’ll discuss actually bringing jQuery into your web pages.</p>  <h1>jQuery Documentation</h1>  <p>This is also a good time to stop and discuss the jQuery documentation.&#160; To put it simply, it’s awesome.&#160; The important thing to remember is that you’re not going remember everything about jQuery.&#160; Every time I sit down to work with jQuery, I have the documentation open and ready to use.&#160; </p>  <p>Everything you can do in jQuery can be narrowed down into 11 different categories:</p>  <ul>   <li>jQuery Core</li>    <li>Selectors</li>    <li>Attributes</li>    <li>Traversing</li>    <li>Manipulation</li>    <li>CSS</li>    <li>Events</li>    <li>Effects</li>    <li>Ajax</li>    <li>Utilities</li>    <li>jQuery UI</li> </ul>  <p>Let’s say, for example, I wanted to wire up a click event for an element on my page.&#160; If I looked under “Events”, I would find the click event waiting for me.&#160; If you go to the documentation for the click event, you’re given a useful and straight forward look at what it does and how to use it.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image1.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image_thumb1.png\" width=\"469\" height=\"477\" /></a></p>  <p>Every documentation page gives you an easy, full source code example.&#160; Not only that, but underneath the code is a working version of the code in action.&#160; Use this to your advantage, and you’ll be up and running with jQuery in no time!</p>  <h1>Visual Studio 2008 Intellisense</h1>  <p>If you’re like me, you use Visual Studio.&#160; If you’re like me, you love Intellisense.&#160; While Visual Studio already has some support for JavaScript Intellisense, wouldn’t it be nice if Visual Studio gave you the same support for jQuery!</p>  <p>Wait no longer!&#160; Around the time ASP.NET MVC was coming down the pipe, Microsoft announced full support for jQuery Intellisense.&#160; If you’re starting an MVC application, you get the Intellisense right out of the box!</p>  <p>But what if you’re working with an older version of jQuery or web forms application!&#160;

regularly scheduled blog post...</em></blockquote>\nAnother year has come and gone, and I feel that 2009 has been a great step  for me in my career and my community contributions.  Taking a look back, here are some of my major accomplishments.\n\n<strong>Speaking</strong>\n\nLast year, I was not a community speaker.  I was just a guy that you saw at the code camps and user group meetings.  However, I made a commitment during MSDN Dev Conference in Washington D.C. last year that I would speak at the Roanoke Code Camp in March 2009.  That just started a chain reaction, leading into more and more speaking in the developer community.\n\nHere’s a line up of the speaking arrangements I had in 2009:\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<ul>\n\t<li>February 10th, 2009 – Hampton Roads .NET Users Group – (Presenter, What Is This WPF Thing?!)</li>\n\t<li>March 7th, 2009 – Roanoke Code Camp – (Presenter, What Is This WPF Thing?!)</li>\n\t<li>April 25th, 2009 – Richmond Code Camp – (Presenter, What Is This WPF Thing?!)</li>\n\t<li>May 23rd, 2009 – NoVa Code Camp – (Presenter, What Is This WPF Thing?!)</li>\n\t<li>September 19th, 2009 – Raleigh Code Camp (Presenter, jQuery From The Ground Up)</li>\n\t<li>October 3rd, 2009 – Richmond Code Camp (Presenter, jQuery From The Ground Up)</li>\n\t<li>October 10th, 2009 – NoVa Code Camp (Presenter, jQuery From The Ground Up)</li>\n\t<li>October 17th, 2009 – Philly Code Camp (Presenter, jQuery From The Ground Up)</li>\n\t<li>October 22nd, 2009 – Old Dominion University (Presenter, Windows 7 for Developers)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nI’m proud to say that I already have committed to the same number of speaking engagements, and that’s not including Code Camps or larger conferences.  This list also does not include SharePoint Saturday’s, MSDN Events, and User Group meetings that I attended as a community cheerleader.\n\nSpeaking opened up a new world to me.  In college, I didn’t speak in public too often.  It’s not that I had a fear of speaking, it’s that I wasn’t practiced at doing it.  By having to put together sessions, and constantly interacting with audiences, I’ve grown quite a bit as a speaker.  Now I look forward to speaking, and I hope for the largest crowd possible.\n\n<strong>Blogging</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">I started this blog in late 2008.  For 2009, I wanted to make it a point to update the blog on a regular basis.  The term '”regular basis” is subjective though.  For me, a regular basis was once every two weeks. </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">That’s going to change in 2010.  I’ve found that everything is bloggable (is that even a word?).  My biggest problem is remembering that I have stuff to blog about, and I’m making efforts to remedy that.</span>\n\n<strong>Writing</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">2009 allowed me to write my first two professional articles.  They sort of came by chance.  A good friend of mine, Steve Presley, passed me a note about an opportunity to write two articles for DeveloperFusion about developing for Windows 7.  So it happened, I was playing around with Windows 7 developer tools.  Everything worked out, and I ended up writing two introduction articles for Windows 7 developers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Very exciting!</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><strong>Hampton Roads .NET Users Group</strong></span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">By far, my biggest achievement this year was the starting of the Hampton Roads .NET Users Group.  Before I start the group, it had been years since this area had a group solely focused around .NET and Microsoft technologies.  Susan was running the SQL Server and SharePoint Users Group, and doing a great job.  However, I felt there needed to be more developer centric discussion every month.  Through the help of Susan Lennon, Andy Leonard, Kevin Hazzard, Darrell Norton, and others, the Hampton Roads .NET Users Group took off.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">I couldn’t have done any of it without the local developer community.  They are the glue that holds this group together.  We can’t have a user group without users, and month after month we have a great turnout.  On January 12th, we’ll be celebrating our 1st anniversary!  I can’t wait!</span>\n\n<strong>2010</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">2010 is going to be a great year.  I have many goals that I’m going to carry over from 2009, and try to expand on.  But that’s for another blog entry.  I hope everyone has a happy new year!  Thanks for helping me be successful!</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">- Kevin

audiences, I’ve grown quite a bit as a speaker.  Now I look forward to speaking, and I hope for the largest crowd possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Blogging</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">I started this blog in late 2008.  For 2009, I wanted to make it a point to update the blog on a regular basis.  The term '”regular basis” is subjective though.  For me, a regular basis was once every two weeks. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">That’s going to change in 2010.  I’ve found that everything is bloggable (is that even a word?).  My biggest problem is remembering that I have stuff to blog about, and I’m making efforts to remedy that.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Writing</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">2009 allowed me to write my first two professional articles.  They sort of came by chance.  A good friend of mine, Steve Presley, passed me a note about an opportunity to write two articles for DeveloperFusion about developing for Windows 7.  So it happened, I was playing around with Windows 7 developer tools.  Everything worked out, and I ended up writing two introduction articles for Windows 7 developers.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Very exciting!</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><strong>Hampton Roads .NET Users Group</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">By far, my biggest achievement this year was the starting of the Hampton Roads .NET Users Group.  Before I start the group, it had been years since this area had a group solely focused around .NET and Microsoft technologies.  Susan was running the SQL Server and SharePoint Users Group, and doing a great job.  However, I felt there needed to be more developer centric discussion every month.  Through the help of Susan Lennon, Andy Leonard, Kevin Hazzard, Darrell Norton, and others, the Hampton Roads .NET Users Group took off.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">I couldn’t have done any of it without the local developer community.  They are the glue that holds this group together.  We can’t have a user group without users, and month after month we have a great turnout.  On January 12th, we’ll be celebrating our 1st anniversary!  I can’t wait!</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>2010</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">2010 is going to be a great year.  I have many goals that I’m going to carry over from 2009, and try to expand on.  But that’s for another blog entry.  I hope everyone has a happy new year!  Thanks for helping me be successful!</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">- Kevin

developers talk about the ruby experience.&#160; Only thing I haven’t done is actually try to do any Ruby development on my own.&#160; That’s going to change in 2010.</font></p>

href=\"http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/5065\">http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/5065</a></em>\n\nIn my current project, I’ve had the need to use a Tab control but the data inside of the tabs was way too hefty to load initially when page loaded for the first time.  Luckily, the <a href=\"http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/\">jQuery Tab control</a> provides this functionality for me already.  However, I needed to find a way to easily organize the tab content on the server.  ASP.NET MVC provides a great structure for this called Partial Views.\n\nIn this quick tutorial, I’ll give you a run down on how to set up a jQuery tab control and how to configure ASP.NET MVC Partial Views to work with the tab controls.\n\n<strong>Configuring Your View</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Since we’re working in ASP.NET MVC, we’re going to talk about our pages in the form of Views.  I’m working with the default “blue screen” ASP.NET MVC application.  After you’ve downloaded and linked the jQuery and jQuery UI scripts to your View (either in the view itself or in the master page), you’re going to add the following code:</span>\n<pre lang=\"html\">    <script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--mce:0--></script>\n<div id=\"tabContainer\">\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"/Home/GetHomeTab\">Home</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"/Home/GetProductTab\">Products</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"/Home/GetContactUsTab\">Contact Us</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div></pre>\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">This code replaces the existing content section in the Index view for the Home controller.  The most interesting part of this is the <strong>tabContainer</strong> div.  Inside of it, we’ve declared a unordered list, and several list items.  jQuery UI uses this determine how to format the tab control. </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">You’ll notice that inside of our list items (&lt;li&gt; tags) that we’re using links to various action links (and yes, I know I could use HTML helpers to build these links for me).  Now, we need to build the views that will be rendered inside the tabs.</span>\n\nHere is an example of building the <strong>GetHomeTab</strong> view.  Nothing special, but make sure that you select <em>Create a partial view</em>.  Partial views won’t have any of the HEAD, HTML, or BODY fluff inside of them.  These are perfect for our tabs.\n\n<a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image.png\"><img style=\"display: inline; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\"

</strong>and <strong>GetContactUsTab</strong>.  Add a few lines of text to the views in so you know they’re working.  Here’s an example of what my <strong>GetHomeTab</strong> looks like:\n<pre lang=\"html\">&lt;%@ Control Language=\"C#\" Inherits=\"System.Web.Mvc.ViewUserControl\" %&gt;\n<h1>Home</h1>\nYou're inside the Home tab, which was rendered via a partial view!</pre>\nBefore we can test, we need to update our Controller to return the views as requested.  Here’s the additions you’ll make to your Home controller:\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">public ActionResult GetHomeTab()\n{\nreturn PartialView();\n}\npublic ActionResult GetProductTab()\n{\nreturn PartialView();\n}\npublic ActionResult GetContactUsTab()\n{\nreturn PartialView();\n}</pre>\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">You can attach models to these views and they’ll work fine.  Build and run the application.</span>\n\n<a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image1.png\"><img style=\"display: inline; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image_thumb1.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"520\" /></a>\n\nAnd to prove that everything is working as AJAX call backs, we can look at <span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">FireBug:</span>\n\n<a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/image2.png\"><img style=\"display: inline; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\"

#2e2e2e;\">Firebug will show that when I clicked on the Contact Us tab, it automatically made an AJAX call to our Home controller and retrieved the partial view.</span>\n\n<strong>That’s awesome Kevin, now Why?</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Tabs can be bloaty.  They contain a ton of markup for rendering inside the tab, and all this needs to be maintained within a single file.  By loading our pages dynamically, we’re eliminating the strain on the server.  Imagine we have 10 tabs.  If the user only needs to access two of them, we’re wasting bandwidth by downloading all the additional markup.  Then the browser needs to render it and store it, waiting for the user to come along and do something.  In an AJAX environment, we only download tabs as needed.  Much less strain on the server.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Second, maintaining 11 small files is much easier than maintaining 1 large file.  If you need to make a change to the Contact Us tab, you don’t need to go searching through the main page to find it.  Instead, you locate the GetContactUsTab view and make your changes!</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">I hope you’ve learned something from this, and maybe implement it into your future projects.  I can tell you that it definitely makes a difference in my app where there are 10 tabs containing a lot of data.  Separating out all the pieces makes it much easier to maintain and update.</span>","html":"<p><strong>Note: </strong><em>This example was built using jQuery UI 1.7.2 (which packages jQuery 1.3.2).  If you use jQuery 1.4.1,

Maryland Give Camp Recap","slug":"southern-maryland-give-camp-recap","markdown":"On Friday, March 19th, 102 geeks ascended to Southern Maryland to help 19 non-profits use technology to promote and grow their organization.\n\n“<strong>How did you hear about Give Camp?”</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">This is a question I was asked numerous time throughout the weekend.  <a href=\"http://jpendarvis.blogspot.com/\">Jim Pendarvis</a>, is a friend of mine, and fellow user group leader in the Mid Atlantic region.  The idea of give camp in the Mid-Atlantic started a little less than a year ago.  Several of us had heard about the success of give camps in other regions, namely Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor.  In fact, there was a conference call between all interested community leaders to work together to bring give camps to our respective areas.  Those plans, as most do, went by the wayside.  Jim didn’t wait.  He continued his plans, and last week it all came together.</span>\n\n<strong>My Charity</strong>\n\nI had the pleasure of working with the <a href=\"http://www.springdellcenter.org/\">Spring Dell Center</a>.  They were lucky to already have a web presence, but the issue we saw was that the page was difficult to maintain and expand.\n\nMy partner, Mike Thomas, and I sat down with Thomas Hoffman from the Spring Dell Center and hatched out a game plan.  We equipped ourselves with a copy of <a href=\"http://www.sitefinity.com\">SiteFinity</a> from <a href=\"http://www.telerik.com\">Telerik</a>.\n\nHere's a video of our presentation:\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param

allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>\n\n<strong>What We Did Right</strong>\n\n<em>Using a CMS</em>\n\nI would say that choosing a CMS over custom building was the best decision we made.  Another group at the Give Camp decided to custom build a solution from the ground up.  It’s a notable effort.  By custom rolling an application, you can provide exactly what the customer wants.  However, no matter what your skill level is, the custom solution is not feasible within 48 hours.\n\nOn the same note, I was brought on to assist the group during the final hours.  They had made progress, but in the end didn’t have a product the charity could sit down and start working with.\n\nIf you’re looking to volunteer at a GiveCamp, bone up on several CMS solutions.  You’re going to be most likely using one.\n\n<em>Scope control</em>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Our charity had a decent list of things they would have liked to have seen in the end product, and I would say we hit 95% of the list.  Near the end of Saturday, we came to a request for an online employment application.  SiteFinity does not (currently) have a form builder built into it, so the process would have to be custom.  However, looking at the employment application (all 6 pages of it), we identified that it would be a bit much to tackle in the weekend.  Thanks to some consulting from Andrew Duthie and Jim Pendarvis, we convinced the charity that this wasn’t a solution we were comfortable attempting.</span>\n\n<strong>What We Could Have Done Better</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><em>Preparation</em></span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">We used SiteFinity, but I had never used it until the first day of Give Camp.  It took us about 3 hours to get something to start working with.  Then I walked around to help other groups get SiteFinity up and running on their machines.  This was time that we could’ve just *been working*. </span>\n\n<em><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Know the Product</span></em>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">SiteFinity is a great product.  My lack of knowledge of the feature set of the product kept me from being able to solve really simple problems.  It took until the second day, and chatting with other groups to realize the potential of the product we were using.  The truly best projects from the weekend were by people that knew the product well enough to just use it.  This gave them more time to spend of customization and enhancements.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><strong>What Was Awesome About Give Camp</strong></span>\n\n<em><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">The Food</span></em>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">I have never seen so much junk food in my life.  You would have though Jim hijacked a Little Debbie truck, and rerouted to Give Camp.  We had a supermarket-worth of soda and water.  I drink a ton of water, and there was enough to last until lunch on Sunday.  Catered breakfast, lunch, and dinner each night added to the awesomeness. </span>\n\n<em><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">The Volunteers</span></em>\n\n“<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Who wants caffeine?” was a common question asked during the weekend.  Volunteers routinely went to get us sodas or 5 Hour Energy’s.  The prepped breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The cleaned up after us.  The volunteers made it easy for us to do our job, and we couldn’t have done it without them.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><em>The Haircuts</em></span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Enough said:</span>\n<div id=\"scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:c54147c1-c252-44f8-ad50-a5f5e75a08c2\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\" style=\"margin: 0px; display: inline; float: none;

style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Give Camp was the most rewarding experience of the my professional career.  The looks and emotions of some peoples faces during the end presentations made it worth the drive and the sleep lost.  I will definitely be back next year, and I encourage everyone to attend a give camp that is near you.  Can’t find one?  Ask me and I’ll help you find one or help you start

bone up on several CMS solutions.  You’re going to be most likely using one.</p>\n\n<p><em>Scope control</em></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Our charity had a decent list of things they would have liked to have seen in the end product, and I would say we hit 95% of the list.  Near the end of Saturday, we came to a request for an online employment application.  SiteFinity does not (currently) have a form builder built into it, so the process would have to be custom.  However, looking at the employment application (all 6 pages of it), we identified that it would be a bit much to tackle in the weekend.  Thanks to some consulting from Andrew Duthie and Jim Pendarvis, we convinced the charity that this wasn’t a solution we were comfortable attempting.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>What We Could Have Done Better</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><em>Preparation</em></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">We used SiteFinity, but I had never used it until the first day of Give Camp.  It took us about 3 hours to get something to start working with.  Then I walked around to help other groups get SiteFinity up and running on their machines.  This was time that we could’ve just <em>been working</em>. </span></p>\n\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Know the Product</span></em></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">SiteFinity is a great product.  My lack of knowledge of the feature set of the product kept me from being able to solve really simple problems.  It took until the second day, and chatting with other groups to realize the potential of the product we were using.  The truly best projects from the weekend were by people that knew the product well enough to just use it.  This gave them more time to spend of customization and enhancements.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><strong>What Was Awesome About Give Camp</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">The Food</span></em></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">I have never seen so much junk food in my life.  You would have though Jim hijacked a Little Debbie truck, and rerouted to Give Camp.  We had a supermarket-worth of soda and water.  I drink a ton of water, and there was enough to last until lunch on Sunday.  Catered breakfast, lunch, and dinner each night added to the awesomeness. </span></p>\n\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">The Volunteers</span></em></p>\n\n<p>“<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Who wants caffeine?” was a common question asked during the weekend.  Volunteers routinely went to get us sodas or 5 Hour Energy’s.  The prepped breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The cleaned up after us.  The volunteers made it easy for us to do our job, and we couldn’t have done it without them.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><em>The Haircuts</em></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Enough said:</span>  </p>\n\n<div id=\"scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:c54147c1-c252-44f8-ad50-a5f5e75a08c2\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\" style=\"margin: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding: 0px;\">

\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Give Camp was the most rewarding experience of the my professional career.  The looks and emotions of some peoples faces during the end presentations made it worth the drive and the sleep lost.  I will definitely be back next year, and I encourage everyone to attend a give camp that is near you.  Can’t find one?  Ask me and I’ll help you find one or help you start one.</span></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1269943200000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1269943200000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1269943200000,"published_by":1},{"id":96,"uuid":"d22d724d-becd-420e-b24b-c945174e4cca","title":"Silverlight

Rocks Roadtrip #DNR_Roadtrip","slug":"net-rocks-roadtrip-dnr_roadtrip","markdown":"<p>This blog post is a long time due.&#160; A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to spend some time with Carl and Richard, better known as the .NET Rocks guys!&#160; Here’s a quick overview of the what happened:&#160; Carl and Richard jumped into an RV, and started driving across the country.&#160; Along the way, they stopped at several cities and did .NET Rocks live in front of an audience.&#160; At each stop, the guys picked up a ride-along to go with them to the next city.</p>  <p>Fast forward to Richmond.</p>  <p>I was in Richmond early that afternoon because I was on my way home from the CMAP .NET Users Group.&#160; I met up with Kevin Hazzard, and hung out at the venue where the roadtrip was going to be.&#160; I was later approached by both Kevin Hazzard and Andrew Duthie, encouraging me to be the ride along for the trip to Raleigh.&#160; I agreed, and the guys put on a great show.</p>  <p>My roadtrip almost didn’t happen though.&#160; As it turns out, I needed to be in Reston, VA on the following Friday morning (Richmond was Wednesday night).&#160; The conditions of the roadtrip was that they would fly me home the morning after next event.&#160; I would not have had enough time to be in Reston by the time that happened.&#160; After a little bit of back and forth, Richard offered to not only fly me to Reston on Friday morning, but also fly me home the following Saturday.&#160; I couldn’t say no to that!</p>  <p>The drive was awesome.&#160; It took about 3 hours to complete.&#160; We had just enough time to stop at the hotel before heading over to Duke University.&#160; The guys put on another great show, and we spent the evening having a few drinks at the pub next to our hotel.&#160; The fun couldn’t last though, because I was at the airport at 5:00 the next morning.</p>  <p>I’d like to give a big thanks to Carl and Richard for taking me on a ride.&#160; Also, thanks to Kevin Hazzard and Andrew Duthie for backing me for the ride along position.&#160; If it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t had been considered at all.</p>  <p>Enjoy a few of the

quick overview of the what happened:&#160; Carl and Richard jumped into an RV, and started driving across the country.&#160; Along the way, they stopped at several cities and did .NET Rocks live in front of an audience.&#160; At each stop, the guys picked up a ride-along to go with them to the next city.</p>  <p>Fast forward to Richmond.</p>  <p>I was in Richmond early that afternoon because I was on my way home from the CMAP .NET Users Group.&#160; I met up with Kevin Hazzard, and hung out at the venue where the roadtrip was going to be.&#160; I was later approached by both Kevin Hazzard and Andrew Duthie, encouraging me to be the ride along for the trip to Raleigh.&#160; I agreed, and the guys put on a great show.</p>  <p>My roadtrip almost didn’t happen though.&#160; As it turns out, I needed to be in Reston, VA on the following Friday morning (Richmond was Wednesday night).&#160; The conditions of the roadtrip was that they would fly me home the morning after next event.&#160; I would not have had enough time to be in Reston by the time that happened.&#160; After a little bit of back and forth, Richard offered to not only fly me to Reston on Friday morning, but also fly me home the following Saturday.&#160; I couldn’t say no to that!</p>  <p>The drive was awesome.&#160; It took about 3 hours to complete.&#160; We had just enough time to stop at the hotel before heading over to Duke University.&#160; The guys put on another great show, and we spent the evening having a few drinks at the pub next to our hotel.&#160; The fun couldn’t last though, because I was at the airport at 5:00 the next morning.</p>  <p>I’d like to give a big thanks to Carl and Richard for taking me on a ride.&#160; Also, thanks to Kevin Hazzard and Andrew Duthie for backing me for the ride along position.&#160; If it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t had been considered at all.</p>  <p>Enjoy a few of the pictures I took below!</p>  <p><a

Guide to Preparing for Azure","slug":"beginner-guide-to-preparing-for-azure","markdown":"We have a project that we are considering to move over to Azure.  However, the move to the cloud can be a bit daunting if you’re not fully expecting certain things.  Cost is really one of the big factors driving our decisions.  I sat down and chatted with my friend <a href=\"http://www.davidmakogon.com/\">David Makogon</a>, and discussed some of the best Azure scenario's for our deployment.  A lot of good information came out of that conversation, and I feel it might be a lot of good information to share if you have a similar situation.\n\nOur scenario: Our application is build on ASP.NET WebForms, and is running on shared hosting.  It’s connected to a shared SQL Server instance through the same host.  The host (who shall remain nameless) is a piece of crap.  Random downtime, poor support, and an overall bad experience.  We were looking at two different options: a dedicated server or the cloud.\n\n<strong>Everything I’m talking about is my understand as of the date of this post (June 1st, 2010).  I cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information after this post.  If it changes, I will do my best to update.</strong>\n<h2>Roles</h2>\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">When looking at Azure, you’re really looking at “roles\".  A roles were are interested in are the following:</span>\n<blockquote><strong>Web Role</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">A web role is a web site or web service running on Azure.</span></blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>Worker Role</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">A worker role is a process that runs in the background to perform tasks.  Think of it as a “windows service” on the web.</span></blockquote>\n<blockquote><strong>SQL Azure</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">It’s like a hosted SQL Server instance.</span></blockquote>\nPricing is based on per role per hour (web or worker).  For example, if I run a web role 24 hours, it would cost me about $2.88.  These are called compute hours.  The problem with the naming is that even though you might not be “computing” anything, you’re still be charged for the role being deployed.  Imagine a single site, running 24 hours a day for 30 days.  This will cost you about $86 a month.  That’s your baseline cost for hosting.\n<h2>Bandwidth</h2>\nNow, people are going to actually use your site.  This requires bandwidth.  Bandwidth is *cheap*.  You’re looking at $0.10 per GB for data coming IN, and $0.15 per GB for data coming out.  And yes, that translates to 10 cents and 15 cents respectively.\n\nBandwidth is also required when you’re talking between roles.  Imagine you have a web role running in a datacenter in Redmond, and a worker role on a datacenter in China.  <em>Ok, I really don’t know where all the datacenters are, but play with me here! </em>If the web role needs to talk to the worker role, that requires bandwidth (and is priced at the rate above).\n\nHowever, if all your roles are hosted in the same datacenter, you don’t have to pay for bandwidth charges.  This is called “affinity”.  If roles are in the same datacenter, they have the same affinity.  Different datacenters, different affinities.  Something to keep in mind when planning scaling.\n<h2>Data</h2>\nWhen we talk about data storage in Azure, there are two possibilities.\n\nFirst, there is table storage.  Forget everything you know about relational databases, because you’re not going to get any of that here.  Data goes in, and a data comes out.  You’re responsible for managing the data.  However, it’s really cheap.  You’ll only be looking at $0.15 per GB for table storage.\n\nSecond, there is SQL Azure.  You can take your trusted SQL Server databases and deploy them to the cloud.  Then they’re used the exact same way as regular SQL Server instances would be used.  For a single 1 GB SQL Azure instance, you’re looking at paying $10 per month.\n<h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>\n<strong>ASP.NET Gotchas</strong>\n\nI’ve written several ASP.NET applications, and I’m a fan of session state.  I’m sure many other ASP.NET developers out there will agree with me.  However, Azure does not have anything in place for managing session state.  Azure is really a “stateless” system.  There are 3rd party examples out there of how to do this, but right now there is nothing official.\n\nThere is a built in membership and roles provider, so don’t worry about that!\n\n<strong>Note About Worker Roles</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">At first, I was considering the thought of not having to run a worker role.  I’m developing a web application, why would I need one?  However, there are a few good reasons why you might want to think about baking in the cost of a worker role.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">First, Azure provides a lot of data on the roles and how they’re performing.  Worker roles can collect and analyze this information on the fly.  Ever have a web application crash?  Worker roles can collect crash information, and send a nice email or log it for future reference.  All this is done independent of the web role.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Second, worker roles can help you programmically scale other roles.  Imagine a site that normally sees less than 1000 hits a day.  Somebody posts a link to the site on Digg or Reddit, and the internet goes crazy trying to access this website.  Normal shared hosting or even dedicated hosting would buckle under the weight of all the requests.  In Azure, your worker role can watch the site and start new instances as they are required.  The removes the strain off of a single process, and balances it between several.  After the internet goes to sleep, the worker role and kill unneeded web roles.  You do have to pay for the roles that it starts up, but hopefully it wouldn’t be for that long.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"> </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Azure is a great solution, and I’m looking forward to using it on future projects.  The upstart costs of Azure hosting can be scary, but you need to think about it long term.  Imagine the costs of having to buy and house several servers for a farm.  Imagine having to pay for a dedicated pipe for all the servers to connect to the internet through.  Imagine costs of system administrators.  Then imagine how much less running multiple roles on Azure would cost.  The cost of Azure will grow as your site grows.  But the goal is that as the site grows, so will your pockets.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">I’m really hoping that I didn’t provide any misleading information in this post.  If you were considering Azure at all, either for a new project or an existing one, hopefully you now have more information than you did before.</span>","html":"<p>We have a project that we are considering to move over to Azure.  However, the move to the cloud can be a bit daunting if you’re not fully expecting certain things.  Cost is

In this session we will look at Entity Framework 4 from the ground level and you will get a solid understanding of it basic principles. We will also go through all of the new features in Entity Framework 4 and see how far it's come since the initial release. If you've never taken a look at Entity Framework, now is the time as version 4 is the real deal.</p>  <p><strong>Bio</strong></p>  <p>Dane Morgridge has been a developer for 9+ years and has worked with .Net &amp; C# since the first public beta. His current passions are Entity Framework, WPF, WCF, Silverlight and LINQ and is currently a Microsoft MVP for Data Platform Development. He works mostly with C#, but is also a big fan of whatever new technology he happens to come across. In addition to software development, he is the host of the Community Megaphone Podcast and also enjoys dabbling in graphic design, video special effects and hockey. When not with his family he is usually learning some new technology or working on some side projects.

Postmortem","slug":"codestock-postmortem","markdown":"Another CodeStock has come and gone, and it seems that we can;t go to an event without having some stories.  CodeStock has provided in so many ways.  Let’s take a look at some of the highlights\n\n<strong>Can I Get A Push?</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">This year for CodeStock, I drove up with my friend <a href=\"http://www.developingfor.net\" target=\"_blank\">Joel Cochran</a>.  Knoxville is about 9 hours away from my area, and I had to drive through Joel’s city in order to get to Knoxville.  It only made sense to stop and hitch a ride.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">This particular story starts around the Virginia and Tennessee border.  We were cruising along, and I glanced over at Joel’s gas gauge.  The exchange went as so:</span>\n<blockquote><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><strong>Me: </strong>Joel, it looks like you’ll need gas.  Might want to stop.</span>\n\n<strong>Joel: </strong>Ah, yeah.  If we get gas in the next half hour or so we’ll be fine.</blockquote>\nFast forward…. 25 minutes.  We pulled into a gas station.  It was a small mom and pop gas station.  An older gentleman was blocking Joel, and slowly limped into the gas station.  Joel decided that it wasn’t worth the time to wait and said, “We’ll just go up to the next exit.”\n\nHalf way to the next exit…\n<blockquote><strong>Joel: </strong>The accelerator’s not responding.\n\n<strong>Me: </strong>What?</blockquote>\nThe car sputtered and coasted.  We rode it on the shoulder for as long as it would go.  Eventually, we pulled to a stop on the side of the road.\n\nSitting on the side of the interstate gives you sometime to think.  For example, I was thinking about why they put gas indicators on dashboards.  Also, why do I choose to ride with Joel when I know that something is going to happen (just kidding)?\n\nWhat did we do instead of just walking to the gas station?  We decided to push the car the mile and half towards the exit.  Did I mention we had to go uphill and it was about 105 degrees in the sun?\n\nMoral of the story: don’t ride with Joel, and obey the gas light.\n\n<strong>The CodeStock Experience</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">CodeStock was in a new venue this year, the UT Conference Center.  Not only was the venue terrific, but the conference hotel was directly across the street!  For those who’ve never been, CodeStock is a two day event.  Unlike most code camps, CodeStock requires a nominal fee (less than $100) for attending.  However, what you get is worth more than what you would get at Tech-Ed. </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">My session was on the second day, and I presented on jQuery.  I got a lot of good feedback and I really hope people enjoyed it.  In addition to my talk, I attended talks on Multi-touch, embracing my failures, how to run a great conference, etc. </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">I spent a little bit of time in open spaces this year, less than normal.  Overall, I was disappointed with Open Spaces at CodeStock this year.  For being in a central location of the conference, it was relatively under attended.  Instead, most of the great conversations happened in the atrium outside the open spaces room.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">Lunch was awesome.  Instead of a single lunch session, there were two lunch sessions.  This worked very well seeing as there was no rush to get food.  Going through the line took a matter of minutes, and then people went to sessions.  Conference catering rocked, and was delicious!</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\"><a href=\"http://www.rachelappel.com\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel Appel</a> gave a great keynote on Friday night.  Listening to her, <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/gduthie/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Duthie</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jennifer/\"

awesome).</span>\n\n<strong>After Parties</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">The best part of the conferences happen after the conference ends for the day.  Thursday night we hung out in downtown Knoxville.  I was able to meet several people I only knew through Twitter.  We had great conversations and truly brought the experience together.  Friday night we hung out in the hotel and played guitars.  Saturday night we hung out at Alan Steven’s house for PostStock.  If your going straight home after the conference, you’re missing half the fun!</span>\n\nCodeStock was a blast, and I

experiences here.  I am not laying blame on any of the tool developers or Azure team.  Frankly, I’m not sure who is should be held accountable in these cases.</strong>\n\nI’ve spend the last day working in Azure, and trying to implement a 3rd party reporting tool into my projects.  For my first choice, I decided to use Telerik Reporting.  They’re a big part of the developer community, and I am willing to give them my client’s money because they do have good products.\n\nImplementing a report should be pretty straightforward, and in most cases it is.  Walk through the designer, connect to a datasource, layout the report, and you’re good to go!  Viewing the report should be equally as straightforward.  Create a form (in this case a WebForm), drop a ReportViewer control, and in the code behind do some voodoo in order to wire the report up to the report viewer.\n\nBut really, our use cases call for only returning the the reports in PDF or Excel formats.  So the above, while doesn’t work, isn’t necessary.  Telerik has a component for processing a report, and dumping it directly to PDF or Excel (in addition to several other formats).  That code too five minutes to wire up.\n\nI go into the Azure Development Fabric, and try to download my report.  The report generator ticks away for a few seconds and then BLAM, <strong>Out Of Memory Exception</strong>.\n\nExcuse me!  The one problem I don’t have is lack of memory, so I scour to the forums to find out what the deal is.  Turns out that Telerik relies on GDI+ to renders reports in various formats.  <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/windowsazure/thread/04db1ebe-36b4-4562-b79c-cc9c61014b83\">Guess what Azure has poor support for?  You bet, GDI+</a>.\n\nThanks ok, Azure is only 2 years old.  You can’t expect the products to have a quick turnaround.  I’ll have to go look at other solutions.  How about DevExpress XtraReports?  A quick Google search for “XtraReports Azure”, and you’ll find out that <a href=\"http://community.devexpress.com/forums/p/90468/312592.aspx\">XtraReports falls into the same issue</a>!  Reliance on GDI+ makes it unusable in an Azure environment.\n\nHow about GrapeCity’s ActiveReports?  <a href=\"http://www.datadynamics.com/Help/ActiveReports6/arWindowsAzureSupport.html\">Supported, but with limitations</a>.\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Rtf</strong>, <strong>Excel</strong> and <strong>Text</strong> filters are not supported on Windows Azure.</li>\n\t<li>When using the <strong>Pdf</strong> export filter, <strong>digital signatures</strong> are not supported.</li>\n\t<li>The <strong>Pdf</strong> export filter cannot access <strong>System fonts</strong>, so you must create a <a href=\"http://www.datadynamics.com/arCONCustomFontFactory.html\">Custom Font Factory</a> to embed any necessary fonts for non-ASCII characters.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\nHoly snap!  So I can’t export to Excel (which is a requirement), but it looks as if I want to create a report I have to embed the fonts in my reports.  Now I don’t know if that’s easy or hard.  I need to test the product to see, but the lack of Excel exporting is knocking the product down.\n\nNow, I have no problem that these providers don’t currently work in Azure.  If you have a code based created around a single technology, it’s not quick or cheap to turn around and make it use another.  However, I wasn’t able to find anywhere on the product sites saying that they do not have support for Azure.  Instead, I had to download the products and waste several hours trying to make the product work in a way that was physically not possible.  Advertising unsupported features is as important as advertising support features.\n\nAnd what’s up Azure team with lack of support for GDI+?  Isn’t the operating system supposed to be on par with Windows Server 2008?  I’m sure I could run my site in IIS on a WS2008 machine without issue.\n\nSo here’s my call:  If you’re working in Azure, and using 3rd party tools for reporting, please tell me what you’re using or if there is something I’m completely glossing over.  If I find something that works and meets my simple requirements, then I’ll give them a shout out on my blog.","html":"<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: I’m simply sharing my

User Group Leaders Guide to the INETA Community Speakers Program","slug":"a-user-group-leader-guide-to-the-ineta-community-speakers-program","markdown":"As an INETA mentor, I’ve received a lot of feedback from my community about different things that INETA has done.  The Community Speakers program was started last year in an effort to help promote community speakers and assist user groups with bringing in fresh, exciting new faces.\n\n<strong>A Little History</strong>\n\nBefore the Community Speakers programs, there was the National Speakers Bureau.  This group consisted of several familiar faces in the .NET community from across the world.  As a user group member of INETA, you could request one of this speakers to come talk at your user group with all expenses paid by INETA.\n\nHowever, you did have abuse of the system.  For example, I’ve heard stories about speakers on the west coast who’d only speak to user groups on the east coast.  Why?  So they could get maximum number of frequent flyer miles.  A bit abusive, huh?  They would turn down a user group on the same side of the country just because they wanted to wait out for a more lucrative offer.\n\n<strong>Changes</strong>\n\nInstead of spending thousands of dollars on flights and hotels for national speakers, INETA decided to abandon that program and focus more on the local communities.\n\nAs a community speaker, you’re interested in a couple things:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Getting your name out in the public</li>\n\t<li>Teaching the skills you have to offer</li>\n\t<li>Free pizza (or tacos)</li>\n</ul>\nNotice I didn’t say: racking up frequent flyer miles.  A community speaker doesn’t worry about that sort of thing.  They speak for the benefit of the community.  Speaking at a user group is a bit of a commitment.  Not only do you have the time involved with preparing the talk, but you have to worry about taking the time away from work, gas to get to the venue, and maybe even a hotel to spend the night.  These things cost money.\n\nSo INETA thought: instead of paying a single person $1000 (I’m rounding here…) for one talk.  Let’s pay several people a maximum of $200 to go out into their local communities and speak.  That's usually enough to cover a tank of gas, and a night in a hotel.\n\nThe Community Speakers program was born.\n\nThere are currently a couple hundred speakers registered with INETA on a variety of topics.  A user group leader can request anyone, and there is a defined workflow between the group leader and the speaker (with INETA as a mediator).\n\n<strong>Tweaking the System</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">User feedback has been very much appreciated by the INETA board.  The process is being tweaked based off our feedback, and it’s only getting better.  However, the one complaint I’ve heard is that leaders don’t know how to use the Community Speaker request application. </span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">In the rest of this post, I’m going show you step-by-step how to request a speaker.</span>\n\n<strong>STEP 1 – Log in to INETA</strong>\n\nGo to <a href=\"http://www.ineta.org\">http://www.ineta.org</a>, and log in to your account (the only your user group is registered under).  If you’re unable to do this, please contact your INETA mentor (feel free to contact me if you don’t know who that is).\n\n<strong>STEP 2 – Find the Community Speakers area</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Menu-Option.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"Menu Option\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Menu-Option_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Menu Option\" width=\"556\" height=\"167\" /></a>\n\nFind the SPEAKERS menu, and select '”Search for and Request a Speaker”.\n\n<strong>STEP 3 – Filter your search</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"576\" height=\"181\" /></a>\n\nMaybe you want someone to talk about ASP.NET or Silverlight.  Here is the place to do it.  Also, the state dropdown will show you states the speakers have agreed to travel to.  If your user group is in Virginia, I’d recommend selecting Virginia.  Press search!\n\n<strong>STEP 4 – Find a Speaker</strong>\n\nNow you’ll see a list of speakers who are registered with INETA, and are willing to travel to your state.\n\n<a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image1.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb1.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"576\" height=\"202\" /></a>\n\nAdditionally, you’ll see links to the person’s website and blog.  Also, MVPs are designated by their MVP logo.\n\nIf you want more information, click the Details link.  This will show you more information about a particular speaker, such as the topics they’ll speak on.\n\nIf you want to continue straight to the invitation, select Invite.\n\n<strong>STEP 5 – Invitation</strong>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">For this example, I’m going to invite my friend Joel Cochran to my user group (Note, Joel is scheduled to come to HRNUG anyway, so it’s perfect timing).</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">On the invitation screen, I see a list of what Joel will talk about, and I can select from that list.  Also, I need to provide 3 dates that are open for Joel.  In case Joel can’t make the first date, he can choose another.</span>\n\n<a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image2.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb2.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"576\" height=\"402\" /></a>\n\nWhen you’re all done, press Submit Request.\n\n<strong>STEP 6 – Success</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image3.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb3.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"414\" height=\"115\" /></a>\n\nAt this time, emails are automatically being sent.  If the speaker accepts or denies the request, you’ll receive an email.  You can also monitor the request by going to the “Community Speaker Requests” section of INETA.  It’s located underneath the Search option in the menu.\n\n<a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Menu-Option1.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"Menu Option\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Menu-Option_thumb1.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Menu Option\" width=\"556\" height=\"167\" /></a>\n\n<strong>STEP 7 – After The Talk</strong>\n\nWhen the talk is over, you’ll be asked to confirm that the speaker showed up and also to rate them.  This is the most important step, since it completes the workflow and the speaker will get paid.  Please don’t forget to do this.\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n\nI really hope this has been helpful for you in learning how to request speakers for your user’s group.  The whole process really only takes 5 minutes (if even that), and most of it is automated.\n\nAs a tip, talk to the speakers before going through the INETA process.  Make sure they are available and discuss options for the talk.  Not only will you build a better relationship with the speaker, but they’ll be more likely to work with you.\n\n<strong>Finally, I am registered as a Community Speaker and I’m available to speak at user groups in the VA, NC, MD area.  I’m booked out from now to June 2011, but if you’d like for me to come to your group, just head to my INETA page <a href=\"http://ineta.org/Speakers/SearchCommunitySpeakers.aspx?SpeakerId=3e8f676b-e542-408a-abd2-d56f6c1ea3d8\">here</a></strong><strong></strong><strong> and request me.  The link is also available on

post, I’m going show you step-by-step how to request a speaker.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 1 – Log in to INETA</strong></p>\n\n<p>Go to <a href=\"http://www.ineta.org\">http://www.ineta.org</a>, and log in to your account (the only your user group is registered under).  If you’re unable to do this, please contact your INETA mentor (feel free to contact me if you don’t know who that is).</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 2 – Find the Community Speakers area</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Menu-Option.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"Menu Option\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Menu-Option_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Menu Option\" width=\"556\" height=\"167\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Find the SPEAKERS menu, and select '”Search for and Request a Speaker”.</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 3 – Filter your search</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"576\" height=\"181\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Maybe you want someone to talk about ASP.NET or Silverlight.  Here is the place to do it.  Also, the state dropdown will show you states the speakers have agreed to travel to.  If your user group is in Virginia, I’d recommend selecting Virginia.  Press search!</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 4 – Find a Speaker</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now you’ll see a list of speakers who are registered with INETA, and are willing to travel to your state.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image1.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb1.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"576\" height=\"202\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Additionally, you’ll see links to the person’s website and blog.  Also, MVPs are designated by their MVP logo.</p>\n\n<p>If you want more information, click the Details link.  This will show you more information about a particular speaker, such as the topics they’ll speak on.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to continue straight to the invitation, select Invite.</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 5 – Invitation</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">For this example, I’m going to invite my friend Joel Cochran to my user group (Note, Joel is scheduled to come to HRNUG anyway, so it’s perfect timing).</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e2e2e;\">On the invitation screen, I see a list of what Joel will talk about, and I can select from that list.  Also, I need to provide 3 dates that are open for Joel.  In case Joel can’t make the first date, he can choose another.</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image2.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb2.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"576\" height=\"402\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When you’re all done, press Submit Request.</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 6 – Success</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image3.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb3.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"414\" height=\"115\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>At this time, emails are automatically being sent.  If the speaker accepts or denies the request, you’ll receive an email.  You can also monitor the request by going to the “Community Speaker Requests” section of INETA.  It’s located underneath the Search option in the menu.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Menu-Option1.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"Menu Option\" src=\"http://ec2-50-16-144-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Menu-Option_thumb1.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Menu Option\" width=\"556\" height=\"167\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 7 – After The Talk</strong></p>\n\n<p>When the talk is over, you’ll be asked to confirm that the speaker showed up and also to rate them.  This is the most important step, since it completes the workflow and the speaker will get paid.  Please don’t forget to do this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>I really hope this has been helpful for you in learning how to request speakers for your user’s group.  The whole process really only takes 5 minutes (if even that), and most of it is automated.</p>\n\n<p>As a tip, talk to the speakers before going through the INETA process.  Make sure they are available and discuss options for the talk.  Not only will you build a better relationship with the speaker, but they’ll be more likely to work with you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finally, I am registered as a Community Speaker and I’m available to speak at user groups in the VA, NC, MD area.  I’m booked out from now to June 2011,

where I was not only functional, but able to provide meaningful feedback about the applications being built and the processes use to build them.&#160; Antech was the reason I found the developer community, and was one of the leading reasons why I started the <a href=\"http://www.hrnug.org\">Hampton Roads .NET Users Group</a>.&#160; Without them, I have no idea where I would be right now.</p>  <p>I’m pleased to announce that on June 1st, 2011, I’ll be starting my new position with ComponentOne as a Technical Evangelist.&#160; </p>  <p><img style=\"display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\" src=\"http://www.componentone.com/newimages/Company/Logos/c1_logo_vertical_black_128.png\" /></p>  <p>In this position, I’ll be working closely with <a href=\"http://helpcentral.componentone.com/CS/evangelists/b/rich_dudley/default.aspx\">Rich Dudley</a> to help promote ComponentOne in the developer community.&#160; As a Technical Evangelist, it is my goal to help you all in your communities in anyway possible.&#160; Please feel free to use me as a resource.</p>  <p>If you’re going to be in the Kansas City area on June 25th, come out to the <a href=\"http://kcdc.info/\">Kansas City Developer Conference</a> to see me!&#160; I’ll be talking about MVVM!&#160; If you’re in the area, you should definitely come out.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1306317600000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1306317600000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1306317600000,"published_by":1},{"id":132,"uuid":"ad93a744-7875-414b-92a1-8c68f9b9f3f2","title":"Review:

Letter To Whoever Designed the Turn-By-Turn Feature for Windows Phone","slug":"open-letter-to-whoever-designed-the-turn-by-turn-feature-for-windows-phone","markdown":"Dear Whoever Designed the Turn-By-Turn Feature for Windows Phone,\n\nFirst of all, to the entire Windows Phone team: Good job with Mango.  I'm highly impressed with several of the features.  There is just one feature that really grinds my gears.\n\nThe Maps application.\n\nYou got that one wrong.  Not wrong as in \"oops, wrong turn.  I'll just take the next right.\" but wrong as \"oops, wrong turn.  Dang, this turnpike is 15 miles long with no exits, adding 30 minute to my commute... wrong\".  That particular example is real life, as I experienced it a couple days ago on a trip to Philly.  Back to that in a minute.\n\nWhere do we being?  How about at the beginning of the experience and work our way through the end of the commute?\n\nImagine you're a user, and you've decided you wanted to take a drive from Chesapeake, VA to Philly, PA.  You pull out your trusty Windows Phone and go to the maps application.  All the folks are raving about this great turn-by-turn feature, and having been a Droid user in the past, you decided to give it a go.\n\nSelecting an address is easy.  Type it into the search box, and tap \"Directions\".  You're provided a map, and your next turn in very large type.  So far so good.  You get into your car, put the GPS in the cup holder and start driving.\n\nFirst thing you're going to notice is that the map doesn't automatically orient itself so you can make logical sense of where you're going.  Most (read: all) GPS software do this.  Even if you're heading west, the map will orient itself so \"west\" is facing up.  With Windows Phone, you have \"tap\" the map for this feature to turn on.  It also enables tracking of your position (also not on by default).\n\nNext scenario, you're coming up to a very important turn.  Most (read: all) GPS systems will warn you 1-2 miles before the turn.  They'll say something like, \"In 1.25 miles, make right turn\".  Makes sense right?  Not for Windows Phone.  You'll hear a very distinction \"beep\" or \"boop\" or whatever.  That's the sound saying you've should have turned 5 seconds ago.\n\nSince you heard a noise, you pick up the phone to see what happened.  It says make \"10 miles, make right turn\".  What it doesn't tell you is that those were the instructions 10 miles ago!  Windows Phone doesn't see the need to provide you up-to-date directional information.  Want up-to-date directional information?  TAP the screen and it'll refresh.\n\n\"You've gone a different route\" is what you'll hear next.  Since you carelessly missed that right turn you should have known about, Windows Phone will gladly recalculate for you, right?  NOPE!  Again, you have to TAP the screen in order to get new directions.\n\nWhile we're on the subject of tapping, Windows Phone will update everything on a tap except one thing: total mileage left and time.  Want to know approximately how much time is left in your commute based on current conditions?  You have to leave the navigation portion of the app and start it again.  Same thing for mileage.  Why can't we update that as we go, or at least when I tap the screen!?\n\nI know many of you will defend this application, saying that's its perfectly acceptable.\n\n<strong>DON'T DEFEND BAD SOFTWARE!  </strong>\n\nIt is sold as a \"turn-by-turn\" navigation feature, and while technically it lives up to that name, it fails to recognize the experience associated with it.  The most common use of turn-by-turn is in vehicles moving between 25+ mph.  You should be able to drop the device in a cup holder and not have to pick it up until you're at your destination.\n\nThe Maps app for Windows Phone encourages drivers to take their eyes off the road, increasing the chances of them getting into a serious accident.\n\nAnd I really didn't want to use the \"G\" word in this post, but look... Google did it.  Google did it 3 years ago.  Google is continuing to make the experience better.  Couldn't you all have just \"looked\" at the Google Navigation app?  I'm sure you could have designed something similar that was more \"metro\".\n\nDon't give me the excuse of \"there are other apps available on the marketplace\".  If the phone is marketed to have a feature, it needs to be the best it can be.  I shouldn't have to drop $40 on another application to replace the functionality the phone was marketed to provide in the first place.\n\nI understand this is \"version 2\", and you all won't get it right until version 3.  So please, take all my comments, grab a Droid/iPhone/Garmin/TomTom and come back with a kick butt new navigation app.  I believe in you.\n\nRock on,\n\nKevin \"it took me 45 minutes longer to get to Philly because of my Windows Phone\" Griffin\n\nPS: For everyone else, leave your thoughts in the comments.","html":"<p>Dear Whoever Designed the Turn-By-Turn Feature for Windows Phone,</p>\n\n<p>First of all, to the entire Windows Phone team: Good job with Mango.  I'm highly impressed with several of the features.  There is just one feature that really grinds my gears.</p>\n\n<p>The Maps application.</p>\n\n<p>You got that one wrong.  Not wrong as in \"oops, wrong turn.  I'll just take the next right.\" but wrong as \"oops, wrong turn.  Dang, this turnpike is 15 miles long with no exits, adding 30 minute to my commute... wrong\".  That particular example is real life, as I experienced it a couple days ago on a trip to Philly.  Back to that in a minute.</p>\n\n<p>Where do we being?  How about at the beginning of the experience and work our way through the end of the commute?</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you're a user, and you've decided you wanted to take a drive from Chesapeake, VA to Philly, PA.  You pull out your trusty Windows Phone and go to the maps application.  All the folks are raving about this great turn-by-turn feature, and having been a Droid user in the past, you decided to give it a go.</p>\n\n<p>Selecting an address is easy.  Type it into the search box, and tap \"Directions\".  You're provided a map, and your next turn in very large type.  So far so good.  You get into your car, put the GPS in the cup holder and start driving.</p>\n\n<p>First thing you're going to notice is that the map doesn't automatically orient itself so you can make logical sense of where you're going.  Most (read: all) GPS software do this.  Even if you're heading west, the map will orient itself so \"west\" is facing up.  With Windows Phone, you have \"tap\" the map for this feature to turn on.  It also enables tracking of your position (also not on by default).</p>\n\n<p>Next scenario, you're coming up to a very important turn.  Most (read: all) GPS systems will warn you 1-2 miles before the turn.  They'll say something like, \"In 1.25 miles, make right turn\".  Makes sense right?  Not for Windows Phone.  You'll hear a very distinction \"beep\" or \"boop\" or whatever.  That's the sound saying you've should have turned 5 seconds ago.</p>\n\n<p>Since you heard a noise, you pick up the phone to see what happened.  It says make \"10 miles, make right turn\".  What it doesn't tell you is that those were the instructions 10 miles ago!  Windows Phone doesn't see the need to provide you up-to-date directional information.  Want up-to-date directional information?  TAP the screen and it'll refresh.</p>\n\n<p>\"You've gone a different route\" is what you'll hear next.  Since you carelessly missed that right turn you should have known about, Windows Phone will gladly recalculate for you, right?  NOPE!  Again, you have to TAP the screen in order to get new directions.</p>\n\n<p>While we're on the subject of tapping, Windows Phone will update everything on a tap except one thing: total mileage left and time.  Want to know approximately how much time is left in your commute based on current conditions?  You have to leave the navigation portion of the app and start it again.  Same thing for mileage.  Why can't we update that as we go, or at least when I tap the screen!?</p>\n\n<p>I know many of you will defend this application, saying that's its perfectly acceptable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DON'T DEFEND BAD SOFTWARE!  </strong></p>\n\n<p>It is sold as a \"turn-by-turn\" navigation feature, and while technically it lives up to that name, it fails to recognize the experience associated with it.  The most common use of turn-by-turn is in vehicles moving between 25+ mph.  You should be able to drop the device in a cup holder and not have to pick it up until you're at your destination.</p>\n\n<p>The Maps app for Windows Phone encourages drivers to take their eyes off the road, increasing the chances of them getting into a serious accident.</p>\n\n<p>And I really didn't want to use the \"G\" word in this post, but look...

should ASP.NET developers consider SignalR for ALL projects?","slug":"why-should-asp-net-developers-consider-signalr-for-all-projects","markdown":"The concept of the “static” web went away a long time ago.  When web developers started looking towards jQuery to build “ajax” web applications, we hit a wall where an instance of a page was a dynamic object to be manipulated.\r\n\r\nThis turned even more when the first HTML5 specs came down the line, and we were introduced to WebSockets.  An amazing idea: a client application being able to connect directly to a server for communication purposes.  I’ve said it before: <em>software development works in a circle.</em>  If you’ve ever written a client-server application, you know what I mean.  In my 9th grade computer science class, I wrote a version of Battleship that used Berkley sockets to communicate peer to peer with a computer over the network.  Fourteen years later, I’m doing the same thing again but on the web.\r\n\r\nThe problem we face when dealing with technologies like WebSockets is that it’s not universally supported across all browser and server stacks.  If we focus on .NET developers, the majority of us are running web applications on IIS version 6 or 7.  WebSockets are only officially supported on IIS version 8.\r\n\r\nIf your users are using IE6-9, you’re also at a loss.  Internet Explorer 10 is the only Microsoft browser to support WebSockets out of the box.  Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera users don’t need to worry – they’re covered.\r\n\r\nSo if we can’t have WebSockets, can we still have a rich peer to peer communication stack like WebSockets? <strong>YES.</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are various ways to implement solutions.  For example, a long time ago I used to implement ‘Interval Polling’ on my applications.  On a standard interval, say 60 seconds, I would go to the server and request new data.  If the server has data to return, that was the time to do it.  If not, the cycles are wasted.  Obviously, this is a huge bandwidth drain and the overhead of each call is cumbersome.\r\n\r\nOther solutions include long polling, which is the same as interval polling, except the request remains open until the server decides to return data or until the connection times out.  Then there is Server Sent Events, which don’t even ask me about.  I understand it’s based off some old Netscape technology, but that’s about it.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of solutions.  Some only work on newer browsers.  It’s a chore: how do you support multiple clients without tons of code rewrite?\r\n\r\n<strong>The answer my friends, is SignalR</strong>\r\n\r\nSignalR is a framework for building asynchronous applications.  For web developers, that means I can build applications that break the request-&gt;response cycle of the web and move to more of a one-on-one connection that old client server architectures used to offer.\r\n\r\nThe mistake a lot of developers make is assuming that SignalR is strictly for web.  That’s incorrect.  For you server infrastructure, ASP.NET is the most common way to building your applications.  However, you can also self host SignalR and also host using the OWIN standard.\r\n\r\nAs far as clients are concerned, JavaScript is the main way.  In fact, when I demo SignalR it’s 100% all JavaScript.  I do make a point of touching on the fact that SignalR is also support in Silverlight, Windows Phone, iOS, OSX, and even in regular ol’ C#.  If you have a single server implementation, you can use multiple clients to connect to it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ok, Griff.  This must complicated to code, right?</strong>\r\n\r\nI would be a bad blogger if I just left you hanging.  Here’s my 5 minute SignalR demo for you:\r\n\r\n[tube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEBaDo_sFfA[/tube]\r\n\r\nThe video does a really good job of showing you all the steps.  There are two parts to a basic SignalR application.  First is the server side, which we build a construct called a <strong>Hub</strong>.  Think of a Hub as a central location for all connections for your application.\r\n\r\nLike code?  Here is ALL the C# I write to implement a server-side function:\r\n<pre>public class ChatHub : SignalR.Hubs.Hub\r\n    {\r\n        public void BroadcastMessage(string message)\r\n        {\r\n            // rebroadcast the message to all the connected clients\r\n            Clients.writeMessage(message);\r\n        }\r\n    }</pre>\r\nThe most confusing thing here might be this mysterious <em>Clients</em> object.  The Clients object is dynamic, meaning you can set properties or call methods on it that might not really exist physically.  SignalR will take all those calls and translate them into messages that are sent to each client currently connected to the hub.\r\n\r\nHere’s a look at the code over on the client:\r\n<pre>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"~/Scripts/jquery.signalR-0.5.2.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"SignalR/Hubs\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\r\n        $(document).ready(function () {\r\n            var chat = $.connection.chatHub;\r\n            chat.writeMessage = function (msg) {\r\n                $(\"#messages\").append(\"&lt;li&gt;\" + msg + \"&lt;/li&gt;\");\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            $(\"#buttonSubmit\").click(function () {\r\n                chat.broadcastMessage($(\"#txtInput\").val());\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            $.connection.hub.start();\r\n        });\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;</pre>\r\nThe request to the SignalR JavaScript file is straight forward, but then there is this magical request to <em>SignalR/Hubs</em> that you might be wondering about.  This file is dynamically generated by SignalR.  It gives your page all the information it needs to talk back to any Hubs you might have created.  Because of this, I can use the object <em>$.connection.chatHub</em> and JavaScript doesn’t throw a fit.  It’s a real object!\r\n\r\nI use the chatHub object in two different ways.  First, I create a new function off of it called writeMessage.  This is called <strong>from the server</strong>.  WAT?  Yes!  If you look at the hub code above, I’m calling <em>Clients.writeMessage<strong> </strong></em>and the client has a method called <em>writeMessage</em>!\r\n\r\nJust below that is a call to<em> chat.broadcastMessage.  </em>Look back at the hub, the method broadcastMessage is defined!  The circle of life is complete.\r\n\r\nOk.  LASTLY, there is this call to <em>$.connection.hub.start()<strong>.  </strong></em>This method kicks off the transport negotiation between your server and client.  Websockets?  Long pollings?  Blah blah blah.  You can override all this stuff, but just let SignalR do what it does best.\r\n\r\n<strong>And there you have it!</strong>\r\n\r\nSignalR is extremely easy to use, and I’m definitely recommending it as a replacement for 90% of the .NET AJAX work I’m seeing done in the community.  Take a couple minutes, download the package via NuGet and try it out for yourself.  You won’t be disappointed.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions, and hit me up on the Twitters <a href=\"http://twitter.com/1kevgriff\">@1kevgriff</a>.","html":"<p>The concept of the “static” web went

year.\r\n\r\nI've been to a lot of DevLink's, and it seems like each year gets better and better.  This was the first time we stayed at the Chattanooga Marriott at the Convention Center, which was a huge change from Chattanooga Choo Choo from the previous year.  I'd say the worst part about the room was that the showers sucked!  First day, there was no hot water.  Second, third, and fourth day, there was no constant hot water.  It would fade in and out every few seconds.  Hopefully next year, they get that sorted out.\r\n\r\nJohn Keller and crew know how to put on a conference.  Three full days of awesome material from awesome speakers.  The conference was kicked off my Douglas Crockford, who is a bit of a God in the JavaScript world (JSON? jsLint?  That's him.).  The big takeaway was that software has to be perfect, but it's written by imperfect people, so it'll never be perfect.\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of the time in the hallways of the conference chatting with attendees and hanging around Open Spaces.  There is a certain recipe for having a successful open spaces, and DevLink didn't have it this year.  I ran two Open Spaces: \"Building Startups\" and \"Getting Started with Technical Speaking\".  Both were lightly attended, and I believe the most successful spaces hosted this week.\r\n\r\nI presented two talks, both on the last day, and right at the end of the day (John Keller, whatever I did to you, I apologize.)\r\n\r\nThe first talk, \"From Idea to Implementation: How We Built Winsitter\" was a talk about startups and how to do it without quitting your day job.  It was a fantastic discussion about what's going through the minds of folks who want to do something bigger, but don't know the approach to take.  We discussed time, money, legal, and other topics that come to mind when considering building a company.\r\n\r\nNext was my \"Getting Started with SignalR\" talk.  I love this talk for so many reasons.  The demos are insanely easy to follow, but the concepts they display really light up ideas in people's heads.  With an ever growing base of web developers, being able to create real time experiences is key.\r\n\r\nI'm looking very forward to DevLink again next year, and I really hope that everyone can make it!  See you there!","html":"<p>First of all, I'd like to give a huge thanks to <a href=\"http://www.componentone.com\">ComponentOne

crew know how to put on a conference.  Three full days of awesome material from awesome speakers.  The conference was kicked off my Douglas Crockford, who is a bit of a God in the JavaScript world (JSON? jsLint?  That's him.).  The big takeaway was that software has to be perfect, but it's written by imperfect people, so it'll never be perfect.</p>\n\n<p>I spent a lot of the time in the hallways of the conference chatting with attendees and hanging around Open Spaces.  There is a certain recipe for having a successful open spaces, and DevLink didn't have it this year.  I ran two Open Spaces: \"Building Startups\" and \"Getting Started with Technical Speaking\".  Both were lightly attended, and I believe the most successful spaces hosted this week.</p>\n\n<p>I presented two talks, both on the last day, and right at the end of the day (John Keller, whatever I did to you, I apologize.)</p>\n\n<p>The first talk, \"From Idea to Implementation: How We Built Winsitter\" was a talk about startups and how to do it without quitting your day job.  It was a fantastic discussion about what's going through the minds of folks who want to do something bigger, but don't know the approach to take.  We discussed time, money, legal, and other topics that come to mind when considering building a company.</p>\n\n<p>Next was my \"Getting Started with SignalR\" talk.  I love this talk for so many reasons.  The demos are insanely easy to follow, but the concepts they display really light up ideas in people's heads.  With an ever growing base of web developers, being able to create real time experiences is key.</p>\n\n<p>I'm looking very forward to DevLink again next year, and I really hope that everyone can make it!  See you there!</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1346498985000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1346498985000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1346498985000,"published_by":1},{"id":148,"uuid":"34845149-5399-4322-8b64-2509991f6acf","title":"Community-based

applications and you shouldn't either.  There is a great package called <a href=\"https://npmjs.org/package/node-inspector\" target=\"_blank\">node-inspector</a> that'll help you in your quest to debug node.js applications.  It's simple to install:\r\n<pre class=\"show-plain-default:true lang:default decode:true\">npm install -g node-inspector</pre>\r\nDon't forget the -g, because we'll want to install this globally.  The install should only take a few minutes, and then you're ready to debug.  Let's run the next two commands:\r\n<pre class=\"show-plain-default:true lang:default

http://0.0.0.0:8080/debug?port=5858 to start debugging</pre>\r\nYour application should now be running in debug mode.  Pop open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/debug?port=5858.  It should look something like this:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.kevgriffin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nodeinspector.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-852\" title=\"nodeinspector\"

Year in Review 2012","slug":"griffs-year-in-review-2012","markdown":"Another year has come and gone, and now I guess it's time to reflect about what got done.\r\n\r\nMy most popular post of the year was <a href=\"http://www.kevgriffin.com/why-should-asp-net-developers-consider-signalr-for-all-projects/\">Why Should ASP.NET Developers Consider SignalR for All Projects?</a>  I felt really good about this post, because I've been following SignalR since it was first announced, and I've seen it grow from a small beta release to a full part of the ASP.NET stack\r\n\r\n2012 also brought on changes in my career.  Last year (2011), I started my own company and did a whole bunch of work with ComponentOne.  Early in the year, we parted ways and I moved on full time as a software consultant.  These past several months have been the most beneficial to me professionally.  I've worked with several fantastic clients, and I'm hoping to see many of them continue on into 2013.\r\n\r\nI'd also say that 2012 marked my departure from .NET as a \"go-to\" solution for all my projects.  As I'm growing professionally, I'm learning that there are tons of great platforms for solving problems.  Most of my non-.NET time was spent working with node.js.  You might even notice that a good number of my blog posts are reflecting around this topic.  I absolutely love where this technology is going.\r\n\r\nThis year was successful for my startup, <a href=\"http://winsitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Winsitter</a>.  My business partner, <a href=\"http://www.fishbrains.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bret</a>, and I did lots of great work and got Winsitter into public beta for all to see.  While we had hopes of going live with our paid model before the end of the year, we've wanted to make sure that everything was in a place where we felt comfortable before charging people money for our product.  My next big push with Winsitter is to get the last wrinkle ironed out, and start grabbing some credit card numbers.\r\n\r\nAs we go into 2013, I have big goals for myself.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'd like to see my businesses grow substantially.  Both Winsitter and Griffin Consulting have the potential to be larger businesses.  I also have a couple other small business ideas that I'd like to pursue.  You never know, I might build something over the course of a weekend that makes millions of dollars (so start saving up).  By the way, did you know I'm available for <a title=\"Hire Me\" href=\"http://www.kevgriffin.com/hire-me/\" target=\"_blank\">consulting</a>?\r\n\r\nSecond, I want to promote developers in the Norfolk/Virginia Beach area much more than I have in the past.  The Hampton Roads .NET Users Group has been great to me, and I still think it's the premier developer group in Hampton Roads.  However, I feel it's very much one-sided.  Keep an eye open if you're in the area, because I have plans.\r\n\r\nThird, INETA growth.  You're going to see some big changes in how INETA interacts with user groups in the community.  I only have one more year to serve on the board, and many of my plans should start falling into place (mwhahaha).\r\n\r\nFourth, I'd really like to speak at a large conference (aka not a code camp).  I feel like I really have a lot of great material to work with and share.  All I need to do is get that material in front of an audience.  You'll see me submitting to several of the large conferences, and then praying that I get accepted.\r\n\r\nThat's a good place to stop.  I'm looking forward to 2013, and I hope you are too.  Rock on folks, and be awesome.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","html":"<p>Another year has come and gone, and now I guess it's time to reflect about what got done.</p>\n\n<p>My most popular post of the year was <a

career.  Last year (2011), I started my own company and did a whole bunch of work with ComponentOne.  Early in the year, we parted ways and I moved on full time as a software consultant.  These past several months have been the most beneficial to me professionally.  I've worked with several fantastic clients, and I'm hoping to see many of them continue on into 2013.</p>\n\n<p>I'd also say that 2012 marked my departure from .NET as a \"go-to\" solution for all my projects.  As I'm growing professionally, I'm learning that there are tons of great platforms for solving problems.  Most of my non-.NET time was spent working with node.js.  You might even notice that a good number of my blog posts are reflecting around this topic.  I absolutely love where this technology is going.</p>\n\n<p>This year was successful for my startup, <a href=\"http://winsitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Winsitter</a>.  My business partner, <a href=\"http://www.fishbrains.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bret</a>, and I did lots of great work and got Winsitter into public beta for all to see.  While we had hopes of going live with our paid model before the end of the year, we've wanted to make sure that everything was in a place where we felt comfortable before charging people money for our product.  My next big push with Winsitter is to get the last wrinkle ironed out, and start grabbing some credit card numbers.</p>\n\n<p>As we go into 2013, I have big goals for myself.</p>\n\n<p>First, I'd like to see my businesses grow substantially.  Both Winsitter and Griffin Consulting have the potential to be larger businesses.  I also have a couple other small business ideas that I'd like to pursue.  You never know, I might build something over the course of a weekend that makes millions of dollars (so start saving up).  By the way, did you know I'm available for <a title=\"Hire Me\" href=\"http://www.kevgriffin.com/hire-me/\" target=\"_blank\">consulting</a>?</p>\n\n<p>Second, I want to promote developers in the Norfolk/Virginia Beach area much more than I have in the past.  The Hampton Roads .NET Users Group has been great to me, and I still think it's the premier developer group in Hampton Roads.  However, I feel it's very much one-sided.  Keep an eye open if you're in the area, because I have plans.</p>\n\n<p>Third, INETA growth.  You're going to see some big changes in how INETA interacts with user groups in the community.  I only have one more year to serve on the board, and many of my plans should start falling into place (mwhahaha).</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, I'd really like to speak at a large conference (aka not a code camp).  I feel like I really have a lot of great material to work with and share.  All I need to do is get that material in front of an audience.  You'll see me submitting to several of the large conferences, and then praying that I get accepted.</p>\n\n<p>That's a good place to stop.  I'm looking forward to 2013, and I hope you are too.  Rock on folks, and be awesome.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1357038009000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1356988930000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1357038009000,"published_by":1},{"id":162,"uuid":"79c0ce54-74e7-4180-a02f-47216cdf77d6","title":"Using Unity for Dependency Injection with SignalR","slug":"using-unity-for-dependency-injection-with-signalr","markdown":"I've had bit of a day, and a large part of it was learning how to wrangle SignalR into using my dependency injection provider (in this case, being Unity).  There are a couple thoughts, that I'd like to communicate to you all in case you're looking to do the same thing.  Also, if you have suggestions on what I could do differently, I'm more than open to hearing.  This is solution that worked for me, and I'm hoping it'll work for you.\r\n\r\n<strong>NOTE: This is built using SignalR v1.0-RC, which is a Prerelease NuGet package.  I'll try to update if this changes after release.</strong>\r\n\r\nFirst, what do we want to do?\r\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">public class MyHub : Hub\r\n{\r\n   public MyHub(ISomeInterface interface)\r\n   {\r\n      // handle constructor injection here\r\n   }\r\n}</pre>\r\nThere's a hub, but it doesn't have a default constructor.  I'd like to be able to have SignalR automatically INJECT the constructor requirements when we load a new instance of the Hub.\r\n\r\nThere are TWO things we need to do.  First, we need to build our container (with Unity) and tell SignalR to use it.\r\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">        public static void Initialise() // this isn't my misspelling, it's in the Unity.MVC NuGet package.\r\n        {\r\n            var container = BuildUnityContainer();\r\n\r\n            var unityDependencyResolver = new UnityDependencyResolver(container);\r\n\r\n            // used for MVC\r\n            DependencyResolver.SetResolver(unityDependencyResolver);\r\n            // used for WebAPI\r\n            GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.DependencyResolver = new Unity.WebApi.UnityDependencyResolver(container);\r\n            // used for SignalR\r\n            GlobalHost.DependencyResolver = new SignalRUnityDependencyResolver(container);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private static IUnityContainer BuildUnityContainer()\r\n        {\r\n            var container = new UnityContainer();\r\n\r\n            // register all your dependencies here.\r\n            container.RegisterType&lt;ISomeInterface, SomeInterface&gt;();\r\n\r\n            return container;\r\n        }</pre>\r\nSimple enough. You might want to know what SignalRUnityDependencyResolver looks like:\r\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">public class SignalRUnityDependencyResolver : DefaultDependencyResolver\r\n    {\r\n        private IUnityContainer _container;\r\n\r\n        public SignalRUnityDependencyResolver(IUnityContainer container)\r\n        {\r\n            _container = container;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public override object GetService(Type serviceType)\r\n        {\r\n            if (_container.IsRegistered(serviceType)) return _container.Resolve(serviceType);\r\n            else return base.GetService(serviceType);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public override IEnumerable&lt;object&gt; GetServices(Type serviceType)\r\n        {\r\n            if (_container.IsRegistered(serviceType)) return _container.ResolveAll(serviceType);\r\n            else return base.GetServices(serviceType);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }</pre>\r\nWhat's going on here? We're creating a new SignalR dependency resolver, and inheriting from the default dependency resolver that SignalR uses. When SignalR goes to resolve a dependency, we're first going to ask Unity if it has an existing implementation. If it does not, we pass the request on to SignalR to get its default (if one is available).\r\n\r\nWhy do we have do this? First, you can just replace the IoC container altogether, but I have had no luck registering all the various types that SignalR uses. This was by far an easier approach.\r\n\r\nYou'd like to think everything will just work now, right? Wrong. The dependencies in your hub still will not injected. My understanding is that this is by design, so here's how to work with it.\r\n<pre lang=\"csharp\" class=\"crayon-selected\">private static IUnityContainer BuildUnityContainer()\r\n        {\r\n            var container = new UnityContainer();\r\n\r\n            container.RegisterType&lt;ISomeInterface, SomeInterface&gt;();\r\n            container.RegisterType&lt;MyHub&gt;(new InjectionFactory(CreateMyHub));\r\n\r\n            return container;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private static object CreateMyHub(IUnityContainer p)\r\n        {\r\n            var myHub= new MyHub(p.Resolve&lt;ISomeInterface&gt;());\r\n\r\n            return myHub;\r\n        }</pre>\r\nThis should be simple to follow. I'm registering a new type: MyHub, and telling Unity how to create a new instance of it. Creating it involves resolving the interface myself, and creating the new instance. This instance gets routed through SignalR and eventually executed.\r\n\r\nI'm also a user of StructureMap and Ninject, and I need to sit down to figure out this same process with those frameworks (if I even need to).  If you already have experience with them, let me know what you did.","html":"<p>I've had bit of a day, and a large part of it was learning how to wrangle SignalR into using my dependency injection provider (in this case, being Unity).  There are a couple thoughts, that I'd like to communicate to you all in case you're looking to do the same thing.  Also, if you have suggestions on what I could do differently, I'm more than open to hearing.  This is solution that worked for me, and I'm hoping it'll work for you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE: This is built using SignalR v1.0-RC, which is a Prerelease NuGet package.  I'll try to update if this changes after release.</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, what do we want to do?  </p>\n\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">public class MyHub : Hub  \n{\n   public MyHub(ISomeInterface interface)\n   {\n      // handle constructor injection here\n   }\n}</pre>\n\n<p>There's a hub, but it doesn't have a default constructor.  I'd like to be able to have SignalR automatically INJECT the constructor requirements when we load a new instance of the Hub.</p>\n\n<p>There are TWO things we need to do.  First, we need to build our container (with Unity) and tell SignalR to use it.  </p>\n\n<pre lang=\"csharp\">        public static void Initialise() // this isn't my misspelling, it's in the Unity.MVC NuGet package.  \n        {\n            var container = BuildUnityContainer();\n\n            var unityDependencyResolver = new UnityDependencyResolver(container);\n\n            // used for MVC\n            DependencyResolver.SetResolver(unityDependencyResolver);\n            // used for WebAPI\n            GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.DependencyResolver = new Unity.WebApi.UnityDependencyResolver(container);\n            // used for SignalR\n            GlobalHost.DependencyResolver = new SignalRUnityDependencyResolver(container);\n        }\n\n        private static IUnityContainer BuildUnityContainer()\n        {\n            var container = new UnityContainer();\n\n            // register all your dependencies here.\n            container.RegisterType&lt;ISomeInterface, SomeInterface&gt;();\n\n            return container;\n        }</pre>\n\n<p>Simple enough.

travel times.  Most people will fly into ORF because it's the easiest to get really good flights for.  Beware though that travel time from ORF to the convention center is hit or miss.  You have to pass Norfolk Naval Base (World's <em>Largest</em> Naval Base), and it's a crap shoot in the early morning or mid afternoon.  With no traffic, it's a 20-30 minute interstate drive to the airport.  In traffic, add another 30 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>TSA at ORF is alright.  There are two checkpoints, and each one takes about 10 minutes on a heavy day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amtrak <br />\n</strong>If you're the type of person who likes to take the train, there is a stop at Newport News.  From their you can take a taxi to the convention center/hotel, all in about 20 minutes.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1359370831000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1359111075000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1359370831000,"published_by":1},{"id":166,"uuid":"01d6e5ca-edd6-4035-b8a8-804654c84949","title":"Simple
